    "At this very moment in time I have been studying to the LSAT and looking to attend law school. For that reason I haven't been able to update this outside of my weekly Top 25 in College Football (possibly College Basketball as well). With the current MLB season winding down I want to do what I did for playoff Basketball teams with playoff Baseball teams. I will hopefully be able to do more writing on this over time but it won't be as often as before, as I have been studying nonstop of the LSAT. Thank you for the patience."
