    "With everything going on with the NBA and NHL for their free agency periods, I want to take some time and talk about some NFL news. The Dolphins are trading Minkah Fitzpatrick and a 5th round pick for Jonnu Smith and Jalen Ramsey. I will be breaking that part down here."

    "The Steelers are going all in currently. I like this deal. While they take a slight downgrade at the Safety position, they beef up their TE and CB spots. I would've preferred a WR instead of another TE when you have Freiermuth, but a pass-catching TE isn't a terrible backup option. I can get that part of the end if a WR2 isn't on the market. I can get that, but it's hard to fully justify with Friermouth. Ramsey is still a solid CB in the league and can help shore up that position for the Steelers. They need more help at that, but losing Fitzpatrick is a tough pill to swallow. It's just hard to understand. They're shoring up one position and leaving a hole in the other. I will give this trade a B-. Solid to get another pass-catcher, but it being a TE isn't great. They're adding more salary, too. I can see some of the vision, but not fully."

    "Yeah, I don't really get it for the Dolphins. I don't like Waller, who they just got in a trade. I don't think he's going to turn back around. Fitzpatrick is a fine addition, and saving money is nice, too. Fitzpatrick fills a safety position, but I'm not crazy about their cornerbacks either. I think they're still trying to compete, and this is telling me that it is a competing move, but I'm not fully certain why they would go through this. I would give this trade a B- as well. It's a lateral move to me and we'll see if I'm wrong about it."

    "This is a very meh trade. I guess the Dolphins would like to fill this need, but this just creates a hole at the CB position. Vice Versa for the Steelers. I get that the Steelers get another pass catcher in this trade, but do they need a TE when they have Freiermuth? Like I said, a WR2 might not be on the market, and this is the best move they can make to get another pass-catcher on the team. Either way, I guess this could make sense, but I just don't get it. With that all being said, this feels like a lateral move for both teams, so we'll have to see how this would play out."
