I've seen him keep the Cougars in most games during his time at WSU. He has the classic strong WSU arm, and his ability to extend the play shows NFL ability. With all classic WSU QBs, his discipline and accuracy need work, but it's teachable in the NFL. I get he's coming out of Miami but a lot of his development was done at WSU. He looks like a great QB prospect to go 1 in this years draft."

I get that the odds have Hunter here. It makes some sense as Watson still has one year after this one, and the Browns can run at Flacco for this year, draft a QB like Manning next year, and have him sit behind Watson next year. Still, my question is, who's to say nothing happens to a Manning or Iamaleava (outside of character concerns)? Who's to say the Browns will be bad next year? If you need a QB, and a first-round QB is available to you, you pick him. I'm high on Sanders. He makes plays, he has a great arm, and he has great accuracy. He knows how to drop the ball. The issue is physicals and decision-making. Undersized and can make bad decisions in the pocket, I can see a concern with Sanders. Either way he should go to the Browns."

    "The Packers are in an interesting situation. They have a mostly complete roster with certain postions in need. One of those needs is a defensive back. While CB is more of a specific need, Safety could help fill that need as well. Starks is the best Safety in this draft, and mentally and physically can be seen as a top 10 pick. The issue? He's a Safety. They usually don't go high in the draft, and most of the Packers' other needs aren't worth a reach when you have a player of Starks' caliber right there. He can be slightly slow, but it isn't enough to make much of an impact. While not fulfilling a direct need, he is a great pick for any team that makes the selection. This pick ties up Green Bay's Safety Corp for years to come."

    "The Vikings have a new QB in McCarthy coming under Center. Coming off a major knee injury, the Vikings need to look into protecting McCarthy more on the O-Line. Jackson is a solid O-Line prospect. With good feet and hands, Jackson could be seen as NFL-ready the day he's drafted. While he has this, he is slow on his feet, as his horrid day against Abdul Carter has shown, and undersized. He needs to be drafted to become an interior O-Line and develop more as a Guard, which the Vikings should look for specifically."

With only Collins, Metchie, and Kirk coming off injury, the Texans need to make a selection to shore up the WR position. Golden is shifty and fast. He has the intangibles to be a solid receiver. The issue is his size and strength. He's short for an NFL WR and can get punked when blocking. Golden can be seen as a WR that you want only one way of being and needing a fast WR, Golden is the perfect player."

The speed off the edge is a huge issue, especially coming from the FCS level. If he can get quicker then he can be a great line prospect, the issue with the speed is concerning."

Harmon seems to have a lot of the necessary size and strength to be seen as a top defensive prospect in the NFL. His issue seems to be his ability to tackle.

With that being said, he's pretty much set as a Guard and doesn't have much of a ceiling to me. What you get now is what you'll get in 5 years. He's good, but I wouldn't expect much development from him."
