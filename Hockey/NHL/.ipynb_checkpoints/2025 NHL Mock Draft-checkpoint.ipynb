I'll do the first round with no trades. While the actual draft will have trades, I am very busy these next 2 days, and the NBA mock took a whole day for 2 rounds with trades. At the end of the day, I realized the trades didn't mean much. It isn't so much what I would do at that point; it was more so what I was predicting, and I didn't want my mock to be predictions; I wanted it to be what I would've done at that selection. Anyways, I will start with the NHL mock draft now as I have the time to."
