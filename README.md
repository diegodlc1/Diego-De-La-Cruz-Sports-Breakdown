# Diego-De-La-Cruz-Sports-Breakdown
Hello! 

My name is Diego De La Cruz. I have graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Data Science and Economics:Mathematical Emphasis. I have worked in sports for the past 3 years and would like to continue doing that. This repository will be treated like my website and will be treated as a place where I write up/code my thoughts for pretty much most team sports. I have worked in College Football, College Hockey, and Soccer, as well as playing select/AAU/High School basketball for most of my childhood/teenage years. With that being said this will be a list of all the sports I will try to talk about.

American Football - College and NFL
Basketball - College and NBA maybe overseas
Baseball - MLB and maybe College and Overseas
Hockey - College and NHL
Soccer/Football - This is a wide range of Leagues and International Play

It is key to note that this will be a place for mostly Contracts, Salary Cap/Roster Moves, Data Projects, Player evaluation/Scouting, and potential tactical/strategic breakdowns. I am not a journalist major nor do I have a passion for sports journalism. I'm not writing about drama on and off the field, the situations at certain teams, and other aspects of sports journalism. If you're looking for that then this is not the place for you. I have a passion for working in the listed above positions so my opinions and thoughts will come from that point of view.

It is worth noting that sports leagues will get most of my opinions during the main part of their offseason as well as during the season. For example, at the time of writing this, it is May 8th. The NFL season is in a dead period and thus I will not be writing much opinions on that sport as most transactions are done as well as the season isn't happening. However, I would write something if something were to happen in the next couple of months. I'm also not one to pay much attention to preseasons/spring training/etc. so I will only write limited opinions on that.

Finally here are some disclaimers.

1. I won't write many opinions, if any at all, on things that I am/was close to. Players I work(ed) with, staff I work(ed) with, teams I work(ed) with, etc.
2. Once I get a job in the avenue of sports I want to then this will not be updated. I don't want my thoughts to be available to others. On top of that, my goal is to become a General Manager and work with player contracts, which may involve me going to law school. If that were to happen then I would also not update this often.
3. As much as I am interested in college recruiting and wouldn't mind working in recruiting and scouting, there are a lot of players and teams at the college level. That means I will not talk much about recruiting and player evaluation at the High School level. On top of that, the vagueness of NIL currently will also not involve me talking about those contracts as we don't have much information on them. Still interested in opportunities at the college level and I think my skills can translate over well.
4. I will talk a lot more about teams that I watch more of/fan of. You may spot that based on the number of stuff that I write about those teams.

**5. With my player evaluations, I'm a huge believer that a player is worth a lot of who they are as people. Due to the first disclaimer as well as not going to travel the country to watch players in person, I won't comment on players' personalities as I don't know who they are. All my evaluations will be based on their play. However, if you want my thoughts as a GM, that would be a good part of my evaluation.**

Thanks for reading and I hope that I can prove something to you all. Please contact me at diegodlc2119@gmail.com to ask for my resume if I prove something to you.
