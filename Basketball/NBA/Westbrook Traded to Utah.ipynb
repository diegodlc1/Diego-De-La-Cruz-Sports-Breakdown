    "The Utah Jazz has traded for Russell Westbrook for Kris Dunn, a second-round pick swap, and some cash. The Jazz are expected to buy out his contract and he is expected to sign with the Denver Nuggets for this coming season. I will go through the impact for all 3 teams."

    "The Clippers will add Kris Dunn for Westbrook in this deal. To me, it makes some sense but not a lot. I feel like Westbrook and Dunn are at the same level, and Westbrook is better both business-wise and experience-wise, and the only thing that the Clippers are adding is some youth and a couple more years as he signed a 3-year deal worth 17 million dollars. That's the only thing that the Clippers are really adding to this trade. I think that Westbrook is a slightly better player than Dunn and Dunn would only be a little better than Westbrook in his second year in the contract. I don't think that this deal is really worth it for the Clippers. I don't think Dunn is that good, I think that Westbrook would bring in more money and experience, and the Clippers just locked in for a 3-year deal instead of having an expiring deal after this season. I don't like this deal for the Clippers."

    "Utah is getting a second-round swap for Dunn in this deal. They're expected to buy out Westbrook's contract and this deal gives way for Collier to get minutes while also gettting a better second rounder, freeing up cap space, and giving a better opportunity to tank. This deal is great for the Jazz as Dunn was a free agent and getting something for him is better than anything else. Buying out Westbrook is fine as he's good enough to make the Jazz slightly better but having him leave the Jazz is better for all involved. The Jazz need to do something about Markkanen but I don't think that anything would happen until at the deadline but to compete with the Nets and Wizards to be one of the worst teams they need to offload Markkanen."

    "The Nuggets add more depth to their lineup with the addition of Westbrook. They had a terrible offseason and gave up Reggie Jackson so they need a backup PG as well as bench options in general. It's a terrible position to be in and the Nuggets need to get anything that they can to compete. With that being said Westbrook is one of the better options. If they can nail a 2-year deal for the vet min then I think that this would be a great deal. A 1-year deal is fine enough though compared to what the Nuggets have currently. The Nuggets are in a terrible position and this being the best move helps but not a lot. This sets them in the second-tier in the West. To me the T-Wolves and OKC are clearly better than them and Dallas are in the next tier down currently. I could even see New Orleans, Sacramento, and Memphis all being better than Denver but I don't think that they are currently. This deal helps them solidify in that second tier though."

    "Los Angeles lost this deal easily. Dunn isn't better than Westbrook in many different avenues of the NBA and he, at best, would be better than Westbrook basketball-wise on the second year of the deal. They also gave a second round swap for this deal as well. Utah getting a second round swap for free is great, getting cap space is great, but I can't give a better grade than B+ when no first round picks or players are received but it's the best grade I can give the Jazz. Denver gets an A- for this being the best move in the offseason, which is a good move. If they get him a 2-year deal then I would give it an A+ but a 1-year deal gets it an A- for adding much needed depth."
