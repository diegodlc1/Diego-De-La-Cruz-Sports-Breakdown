    "With the Nuggets in cap hell, this is a great move to the Nuggets to not only add depth but also an upgrade from Reggie Jackson that they had last year. This is a solid deal for them. If I were the Nuggets I would hope for a second year on this deal and not just a player option, however, I understand why Westbrook would hold out for a player option. If he performs well next year by helping the Nuggets win the Title, he could get a nice payday after that. For me, I understand why the Nuggets did this deal and I also understand that Westbrook would have more leverage than the Nuggets, but I feel like I would've tried hard to get the second year guaranteed and only having a player option would mean that if Westbrook performs the Nuggets will be in the same situation as they are in this year and if Westbrook plays bad then they are stuck with a bad Westbrook for another year. The best situation in this case would be if Westbrook performs what he is expected, maybe less, the Nuggets win the title, and keep Westbrook next year. This would be the best-case scenario but I don't see a scenario where the Nuggets win a title and keep Westbrook for the following year. Now granted I think that if the Nuggets win a title I don't think anyone would care and be happy that another title was won. In other words, this move is the best move that the Nuggets can make to win a title with what they have available. I will give this contract signing a B-. The contract is not great for the Nuggets but I understand why they gave it to Westbrook. At the same time, it is the best move that the Nuggets can make to try and win a title. I don't think that they will but hey they will sell a good amount of Westbrook jerseys so it may be worth it based on that as well."
