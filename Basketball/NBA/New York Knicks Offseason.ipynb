    "Currently, the Knicks have 7 roster spots guaranteed with Anunoby having a player option and Sims on a team option. They also have 2 late firsts and an early second-round draft pick this year. The 2 firsts will account for an extra 4.6 million dollars, and the early second I would say accounts for 1.1 million dollars. With this, these 3 players will add to the 7 already on the roster for a total salary being around 150.6 million dollars. I will go into what the Knicks need to do with the contracts on the roster for this year, and the next year, and look into potential trade and free agents."

If the trade can't happen or Hartenstein is going for more than what the Knicks want to pay, then Achiuwa and the TPMLE would be the best option.
