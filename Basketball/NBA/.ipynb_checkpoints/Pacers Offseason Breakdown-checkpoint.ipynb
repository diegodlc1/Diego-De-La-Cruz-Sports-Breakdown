    "For Toppin, I think that a team will offer more than the max the Pacers can offer. I think that Toppin can be a solid starting Power Forward on a lot of teams and if I'm the Pacers, for this team he is only worth around 15 million dollars and I think a team will offer more and a starting position. However, I can see a way that Toppin stays."

    "For free agency I can see 2 options happening, either the Pacers keep Siakam and get someone for the taxpayer exception or the Pacers keep Toppin and get to sign another player in free agency. The reason that I say this is because I can see Toppin getting around 18 million and the starting job at the minimum and the most likely salary is around 21 million with the increase in the cap and a starting job. The main question is that who would the Pacers get in free agency with the extra money they can spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pacers keep Toppin I could see Klay Thompson and an outside chance of James Harden or Paul George of coming here. Honestly I don't think that either Thompson or Harden are better than Sikam and a taxpayer mid-level exception, however if PG declines his player option I think the Pacers should make a push for him and drop Siakam. However, I think that PG will accept his player option and in this situation Siakam stays.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pacers keep Siakam then they would have a taxpayer mid-level exception to use it possibly on Talen Horton Tucker, Caleb Martin, Royce O'Neal, or Kyle Anderson.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think thaat Siakam staying is the most common option and aiming for Kyle Anderson or O'Neal are the most reasonable options that they can get. I'm going to give them Anderson since I think that Indiana is one of the most attractive destinations that he can get paid more than staying with the T-Wolves where O'Neal can make more money with the Suns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For trade options the Pacers have a lot of pieces but to be honest I don't see them parting ways with many of their pieces. Maybe Jackson and Smith but honestly the only player I can see is McConnell pulling something. I think that a contending team in desperate need of a point guard or a tanking team looking to free up cap space would try and get him. Thinking in that these are the teams I can think\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat, Suns as contending teams and Jazz and Blazers as tanking options with the potential of the Nets once they decide what they're going to do. Honestly McConnell won't be moved for a tanking team unless at the deadline so the Heat and Suns are really the only 2 options for this team.\n",

    "With these 2 possible teams only the Sun would make the move. The Heat have Rozier and to me they're not in desperate need of a PG, a potential need at the deadline but not a necessity right now.\n",

    "For the Suns this is the only team that McConnell might go to and even then I can't see a trade for both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that for now the Pacers have 13 players and use 2 of their draft picks, probably combining the 2 late picks to move up in the second. This is the offseason I see and then, however, I see the Pacers being a very busy team during the season and going into the trade deadline."
