    "I wasn't planning on writing something today but with this news breaking out, and with me writing about Caruso recently, I wanted to get my thoughts down right away before any more moves are made. Like I predicted in my previous writing for Caruso, he went to OKC. I thought that the Bucks and the Suns would be better fits, but I predicted that he would end up at OKC. With that being said I want to write about this move in context with OKC, the Bulls, and the next moves for the Bulls."

    "The Thunder gets a starting SG, which was the biggest hole in their starting lineup. I like Isaiah Joe but only as a backup. I don't think that he is a starting piece on a Championship team, but I do think that he can be a good bench piece for this team. With that being said, the question ends up being for this team is what should they go after in free agency. I like Caruso and I do believe he can be a starter, but to be honest, SG is still the weakest position in the starting lineup. I thought going for a PF or C and repositioning everyone else was a better move. Now with this move, it's making me think a little. I think that size will still be a slight issue for the Thunder. I think teams like the Mavs, T-Wolves, and maybe the Nuggets will still cause problems in the West for them. Caruso can help in the rebounding department but I don't think that Caruso can outrebound a big. With that being said, there are 2 options that the Thunder can go after. Get a starting PF/C and move Caruso or Dort to be a bench option or go after 2 great backup bigs who are willing to play that role. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the Thunder go for the first option then what I wrote in the OKC Thunder offseason moves document will give a full breakdown of that. I think that Hartenstein will be the best option and then filling in the rest of the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Thunder were to pick the second option, I can see this team adding 2 solid bench pieces to add to the frontcourt. They need to fill the need for someone who can rebound and if they can score that would be an added benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking 2 from this list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Andre Drummond, Jonas Valan훾i큰nas, Kyle Anderson, Obi Toppin, Precious Achuiwa\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that they can get a much-needed fill into that position. I think that they need to pick one of Drummond and Valan훾i큰nas, then pick one of Anderson, Toppin, and Achiuwa. I lean towards Toppin here as he fills the middle ground of being an offensive threat while also being a rebounding threat, while Anderson and Achuiwa specialize in one over the other. Toppin's age also helps a lot. The Thunder can aim for 2 of these players and be under the cap still coming into next season. The combination of any of these contracts will not add up to 41 million dollars a year. Honestly, they may be closer to the floor than the Cap with these moves."

    "The Bulls bring in a young guard to pair with Coby White in Chicago. This trade is telling me that the Bulls are looking to blow up and rebuild this team. Some will say that this is coming a year late but I would disagree. This year's draft doesn't have a great piece to tank for and that's why not a lot of teams decided to tank. On the other end, next year's draft looks to have 3 of those prospects so blowing it up now is best. I think that this is a decently fair trade for both teams. I think that the Thunder won it, but Giddey is better than most top draft picks this year, if not more. Caruso is an injury-prone player. Do I think that the Thunder won this, yes the Bulls should've asked for a draft pick, but let's not pretend that Caruso hasn't played a full season in his career. He is injury-prone and 30. The Bulls get a player who is young and is better than pretty much everyone in this draft. I think that this is a good trade for the Bulls. A young guard who they can try to develop these next couple of years in a low-stress situation."

    "This trade points to Chicago looking to blow it up and tank this coming year. I think that everyone is on the trade block outside of White and Dosunmu. With that, I will be focusing on 3 players, LaVine, DeRozan, and Vucevic. I would like to add Ball to this list but to be honest, he has negative trade value and the Bulls should hold onto him as this is the lowest his stock will ever be. It can only go up from here. Patrick Williams is another player that could have some value, but he's also young so the Bulls could keep him to see how he continues to develop. Not untouchable, but they can keep him. I'm going to go from least valued to most valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Vucevic.\n",
    "The 33-year-old Center is the player with the least value on this team. Due to his age, current stats, and position, only contending teams can try to get him. This list will be below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Knicks (If they Lose Hartenstein), New Orleans (if they lose Valucuinas), Warriors, and Grizzlies\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, the Knicks play too physically to incorporate a 33-year-old Center. I think Mitchell Robinson fits the playstyle better as well as Hartenstein may stay after the move that OKC did to get Caruso. Vucevic is an older, better version of Valucuinas, but I don't think that he is the piece that the Pelicans need to win as he is only a small upgrade from Valucuinas. This leaves the Warriors and the Grizzlies. Either team can benefit from him. The question is are the Warriors going to try and push for a title one last time with Curry under contract for 2 more years? I think that they will take a player under contract for 2 more years to make that final push, which is what Vucevic is. The Grizzlies need some front-court help and with Ja Morant coming back for a full year, which he led them to a 2-seed just 2 seasons ago, he can be the help needed to compete with the front courts of Denver, Minnesota, and Dallas.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, the question is what can be offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, the trade will revolve around Chris Paul.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chris Paul, Moses Moody, and a First-Round Pick, or Chris Paul, a first, and a pick swap are to only thoughts on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chris Paul is on an expiring and can be a tank commander while also freeing up 30 million for next year. Moody is a young player who the Warriors would trade to help Chicago get proven young players. Vucevic isn't that good and commanding a Kuminga or Podz would be hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Grizzlies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kennard (Pick up team option), Rose, Aldama (Pick up team option), maybe a pick (I think Aldama has good value)\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that this would be a good trade for all involved. I like Aldama as a player and is a better young player in terms of need for the Bulls than Moody. Kennard plays tank commander and Rose comes back home. This would involve no picks as I think that Aldama has good value for a young player and Vucevic doesn't have the most value in the world. This would free up 17 million for next season.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that between these 2 trades, the Bulls would take the Grizzlies offer. A better proven young player (Aldama) and Rose comes back home which would sell tickets that the owner would want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now DeRozan.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is also interesting. DeRozan is old now but he has more value than Vucevic. The Bulls would need to get a sign-n-trade out of this though, which would tank the value a little bit, but DeRozan will have full power in where he will go. I see only 2 options, he goes to a title contender or he goes to the Lakers in a sign-n-trade. Knowing this I can see a couple of teams that could use him. Indiana, Clippers, Mavs, Suns, and Lakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the market, I think DeRozan could get around 30 million a year and the Bulls will not have much say on the package. Looking at the teams I think that DeRozan would approve 4 destinations, the 4 Western teams. Clippers and Lakers in LA, the star power in Phoenix, and the Finalists in the Mavs. I think DeRozan will say he'll go to any of them and the Bulls can pick the team with the best package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clippers: Nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Lakers: Hachimura, Vanderbilt, and a protected first\n",
    "\n",
    "Suns: Nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Dallas: THJ, Jones Jr.(sign-n-trade)/Green\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this, Dallas' offer is the best. Remember, a sign-n-trade will net something of less value. One of Jones Jr. or Green is a better outcome than anything that the Lakers have. THJ can play tank commander for a year and DeRozan goes to chase a title with Dallas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally LaVine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one will warrant more teams involved while Chicago will have more power in deciding where he will go. LaVine is a player that Most teams will take. The only teams I will automatically exclude Washington and San Antonio. Washington has no direction currently and adding LaVine will not benefit this team at all. San Antonio has a direction, however, that direction doesn't involve LaVine. Other than those 2 teams, any team would take LaVine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I will narrow down to teams in need of a Shooting Guard or LaVine is a clear upgrade to the current Shooting Guard (key word Clear). This will include teams that have a Shooting guard in Free Agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boston, Nets, Charlotte, Denver, Detroit, Golden State, Houston, Indiana, LAC, LAL, Memphis, Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, New York, OKC, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento, Toronto, and Utah.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I will eliminate teams that have an SG that fits their system, any team that is further than LaVine to be playoff contenders, and teams that have recently acquired an SG, or has a young SG that has the potential to be better than LaVine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is:\n",
    "Denver, Golden State, Indiana, LAC, LAL, Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Orlando, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento, Toronto, and Utah.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will eliminate Philly and Toronto as Philly won't have enough trade pieces available due to no one tradeable that is on the books right now. Toronto is realistically more than a Zach LaVine away from the title. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now looking above this is the trade I can think that all teams can make:\n",
    "\n",
    "Denver: Over Second Apron\n",
    "\n",
    "Warriors: Chris Paul, Podz or Kuminga, Moody, maybe some picks\n",
    "\n",
    "Indiana: Combo of Nesmith, Mathurin, or Nembhard, maybe some picks\n",
    "\n",
    "LAC: None really\n",
    "\n",
    "LAL: A Bunch of picks with Russell and Hachimura/Reaves\n",
    "\n",
    "Miami: Around Herro and Jaime, have Richardson and Martin pick up options, then maybe a Pick\n",
    "\n",
    "Milwaukee: None really\n",
    "\n",
    "New Orleans: Ingram/Zion, Murphy (pick up option)/Nance Jr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orlando: Isaac, Anthony, Black\n",
    "\n",
    "Portland: None Really, center around Grant add some young players to take on contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Sacramento: None Really\n",
    "\n",
    "Utah: Collins/Sexton, Kessler/George/Bazely/Lofton/Hendricks, and picks\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this let me break it down. Denver can't aggregate to get a player, LaVine's contract would need to be aggregated. LAC and Milwaukee don't have the young players that I believe the Bulls will ask out of any trade. Portland and Sacramento have pieces but I think that both situations are too complex for a deal to go through. The Kings aren't giving up half of their starting 6 for LaVine, which is what they would have to do to make a trade go through. Portland has the Grant contract to give up, but it's a terrible contract that the Bulls won't take on for the tank. 4-years is a long time for a tank commander.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't eliminate any teams from this. Looking at the remaining trades I think that in some form the other team will accept. Warriors trading youth for one last title, Indiana for the title run, LAL for the title run, Miami for the title run, New Orleans re-tool and title run, Orlando make the push to be a top team, Utah make a push to be a playoff team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these I think that the trades I think that Chicago would take in some form:\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden State, Indiana, Miami, New Orleans, Utah\n",
    "\n",
    "With this narrowed down I think that Miami and Utah have the weakest offers. Taking on Collins' contract for 2 years is a turnoff and Miami's package doesn't match up to the rest. This leaves these teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden State, Indiana, and New Orleans\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that the Bulls will take either trade from New Orleans, Zion and Nance or Ingram and Murphy, the Bulls would probably want Kuminga over Podz, and the Bulls would take Nembhard and either Mathurin or Nesmith. Thinking about this I want to go back to looking at these teams. I think that Golden State doesn't have a necessary push to get LaVine and neither do New Orleans. These teams have SG and are lacking in other positions. New Orleans has McCollum and they need a PG first before they start thinking about other positions. The Warriors have Podz to step into an SG role and they need a Center before thinking about anything else. This leaves Indiana. I think an Indiana trade is the most likely outcome and will revolve around 2 of the 3 listed players and some picks. This will push Indiana to win the East and give the Bulls the young talent in the NBA that they'll look to get. "
