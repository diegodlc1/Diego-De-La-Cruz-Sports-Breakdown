    "For the 3 team options, we have Springer, Hauser, and Queta. I think that you should pick up Hauser's option. He is a good player that you try to keep on your team. For Queta, I say that you can pick up his option. He's only making 2.2 million for next year and has a good enough impact for the role that he would play next year. I think that you let Springer walk. I get it that he's young and could have some trade value but a sign-n-trade isn't possible with him if they sign him to the option then they would be over the second apron. I say that 4 million is too much for the minimal impact that he has on the team. With the deduction of the 4 million, the Celtics will be just below the second apron. They would also have 11 players under contract currently. \n",

I think that it's possible and neither of them should have too much of a market. The issue is the money if one of them does have a market, then the Celtics can't compete with them. I'm going to assume that the Celtics can keep them, I don't think they'll have that much of a market, and they would have 13 players under contract. I would sign them for 2 years around 4.5-6.5 million for both to try and dissuade much interest from other teams. These moves put the Celtics above the second apron with 13 players on the roster.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, you use the 2 draft picks that you have and draft rookies in this draft to round the team to 15 players on it."

I think that Horford will retire after this year so don't extend him until the end of the year.\n",

    "Out of all the options, it's important to keep Hauser in for a longer deal. Giving him a 2 year deal with an added player option would be a good starting point. I'm not sure about the money aspect, I would say around 12-18 million a year doesn't seem like a bad range, but giving him this deal would help secure him for the next couple of years. Outside of him no one else that had an option deserves to be extended."

The 2 players I can think that are worthy to be traded is Derrick White and Springer if they pick up his option instead and move him.

I think that White will stay at the end of the day.\n",

A tanking team with a vet under contract for more than a year or a young team that has a vet and takes a chance on Springer would be the only options. With that in mind this is a list of teams that match that:\n",

Curry plays more as a natural 2 than Carter, however, Carter might be cheaper in sense of draft capital due to his contract, 1 second rounder probably gets the deal done with Springer. If I'm the Celtics though I'm asking Charlotte about Curry. He is worth Springer and 2 seconds which should get the deal done for the Hornets. This gives the Hornets a young talent to see what he's worth, while also being his hometown of Charlotte. It also brings Curry on a Championship team that could use him.\n",
