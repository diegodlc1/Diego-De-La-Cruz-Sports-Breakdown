    "The Clippers are essentially trading Powell for Collins. I like the move. Powell is on an expiring contract, and an extension isn't going to be worth it for the Clippers. His contract length doesn't match up with the rest of the lineup at that point. He's 31 and may look to be on the downtrend in production. With that being said, the Clippers did have a hole in the frontcourt that needed to be filled, and Collins would be a solid addition for that. He's getting slightly overpaid, but on an expiring contract, and the market next season won't net much for Collins, as I feel like most NBA contracts will be coming back down to Earth. Either way, if the Clippers are serious about getting Beal, then I would love this trade for them. At the same time, they need to fill out the backcourt. Maybe bringing back Amir Coffey is the best option at this point if they can't get Beal, but either way, this is a solid trade for the Clippers. I'll give it a B+ grade. They probably have a plan for the backcourt that will make this an A or A-, but at the moment it's a B+."

    "I mean, the Heat got a steal out of this deal. Giving Kyle Anderson and Kevin Love to get Norman Powell is a great deal for the Heat. Anderson is a bench player, and Love is an end-of-the-bench player. They gave that up to getting a starting player. It's a great deal. However, I don't think Powell fits well. I know the finances don't work as well, but I would much rather have John Collins than Norman Powell if I were the Heat. I mean, you got a bargain for Powell, but does he really fit in the starting lineup? Moving Wiggins to the 4 and putting him at the 3 is probably the best option, but I feel like it's very redundant to have both Herro and Powell on the team and having Wiggins play out of position at the 4. I just don't get that part when you have another hole at the PG position, as I like Davion Mitchell, but he's a great backup, but one of the worst starters. Either way, I can't be mad at them for jumping at this deal. I'll give it a B grade as I like the deal but hate the fit."

    "Utah, you sold too late. These guys should've been traded either last year or before the most recent CBA took effect. These guys' contracts aren't great for any team to take on, and when you decided to tank, you should have doubled down. Getting pennies for what you could've gotten before the new CBA. Either way, it is what it is, and now you have to live with what you have. I am glad they picked a direction now. They don't need to sit guys to tank when their team isn't great as is. They can give minutes to Kessler now, or give minutes to other guys to develop and see what they have. The best thing in this trade will be the return they get out of Anderson and the minutes they give to their youth. I think Anderson will have a solid market. 9 million for a solid bench piece that any competing team would love ot have. Any competing team with 9 million in expiring/dead contracts would love to take on Anderson. I'll give this trade a C-. Should've gotten more for Collins, but it's not an F since they have a clear cut direction now and don't need to tank by sitting players."

    "LA did some great business, Miami did some good business, and Utah could've done a lot better. I do want to talk a lot about this CBA at some point, as I feel like what Utah is doing is an interesting look into what the NBA is trending towards in contracts. Either way, I think that this was an interesting trade altogether, but I will say that the Clippers have gotten the best end of this trade."
