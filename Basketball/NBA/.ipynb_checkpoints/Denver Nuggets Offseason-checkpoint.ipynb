    "With everything that I described above, the Nuggets would be below the first apron. I believe that they would still have their TMLE available to be used. This would be something to bring in a backup SG or maybe a backup Center. Take a chance on THT on a prove-it deal. I think that could be the best player they could realistically get. Even then I'm not sure if that's the move that makes them title contenders. It's tough for them and honestly, I can see one move being done, trade a player.\n",

Murray has an expiring, but it would be a mistake for the Nuggets to trade. That leaves Aaron Gordon, Christian Braun, and maybe Payton Watson with some value. The Nuggets shouldn't trade the Braun or Watson. The Nuggets would have no bench if this were to happen. If the Nuggets trade both Braun and Watson, they will probably get a solid starter at SG to replace KCP but will have a nonexistent bench. If Gordon and one of the 2 go, the Nuggets need to get 3 players back. A starting SG, a starting PF, and another one of those 2 positions, whichever of the 2 goes.\n",
