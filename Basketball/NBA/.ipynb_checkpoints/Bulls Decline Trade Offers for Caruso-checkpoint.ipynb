    "Reports have came out that the Chicago Bulls has passed on multiple offers to trade Caruso this passed offseason. Supposidely, a top 10 pick in the 2024 draft has also been offered in these trade talks. Here I will talk about why the Bulls did this, what I think about it, and future thoughts on Caruso."

    "Alex Caruso is a 30-year-old guard for the Chicago Bulls. The undrafted Guard has played 7 seasons for the Lakers and the Bulls, putting out spectacular work as a great role player for both teams. With that being said, Caruso signed with the Bulls after the Lakers rejected negotiations with him and went to the Bulls in free agency where they picked up DeRozan. Since Caruso came, the Bulls ended as a 6-seed. 10-seed, and 9-seed in the last 3 years. He now has one year on his contract as a potentially valuable trade piece this coming season. With that being said, I know why the Bulls want to do it. I see 3 reasons. The first reason is that the Bulls want to sell seats. You sell seats by having a competing team, and Caruso can make any team a competing team as a role player. Another reason is that the Bulls may still have a shot. Let's not forget that 3 years ago when Chicago first got Caruso, DeRozan, etc. they were a first seed for a good portion of the year. If they can stay healthy I can see this team compete again. The other thought is that Caruso is worth more than a top-10 pick in this draft. This draft isn't great and a top-10 pick in this draft is at most a Caruso player. Why take that when you're still technically competing?"

    "I honestly get why the Bulls did. I agree with the move too. Ownership wants to make money and having Caruso helps sell seats. This draft is weak and stating a top-10 pick in this draft is a deal breaker, I think it's ridiculous when a top-10 pick in this draft will just give you another Caruso. I also think that this is the last year for the Bulls. Lonzo will come off the books after next year, Vucevic off in 2-years, and DeRozan is off the books. The Bulls can compete maybe one more time and then blow it up. Caruso can be a very valuable piece next year at the deadline, once the Bulls see another play-in game I could see ownership signing off on a Caruso trade. I think it's fine for this deadline if you want to compete one last time with a healthy team and then trade him off."

    "I think that the Bulls need to blow it up this year. DeRozan is off the books now, and the Bulls need to get rid of everyone that isn't LaVine and White. I think that LaVine is still decent enough for the Bulls, and relatively young enough, however, he isn't going to be worth the value he would bring in if was traded this year. With that being said Caruso would bring a lot of value. He has an expiring where tanking teams will take him, he can be a piece on a competing team, but I don't think that a rebuilding team will take him on unless they're on the cusp. To be honest I think that a competing team taking him on would be the best trade to make. With that being said I think that these teams are the best to taking him.\n",

    "Denver (if KCP doesn't resign), Golden State (if Thompson leaves), Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Philadelphia, and Phoenix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, of these teams, I think that Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, and Phoenix would be the best teams to land him, assuming KCP stays with Denver. The reason I narrowed to this team is that these are the teams that are right there. I think that Milwaukee needs a piece like Caruso, OKC needs a good defensive rebounder, Philadelphia has a lot of cap space to spend this year and after they re-tool around Maxey and Embiid they can make a push, and Phoenix needs to make any move they can now to try and win a title. At this moment in time, though Milwaukee, OKC, and Phoenix are truly the only 3 teams that have decent assets for the Bulls to make the trade, I think that OKC probably has the best assets out of them all. Honestly, I think a team like Milwaukee or Phoenix will fit his skillset and fill the need that they have for him, I just think OKC would have a better package which Caruso isn't good enough to force himself into a team. I think that OKC needs to get bigger than Caruso. When it's all set and done, Milwaukee is the best fit for both ends of this deal, Caruso gets a starting spot and competes, while Milwaukee fills the Shooting Guard hole with a defensive guard that can make up for Dame's defensive shortcomings. Phoenix is fine it's just Phoenix would offer a bench role to Caruso and not a starting position, but they would make a strong push. The issue for both Milwaukee and Phoenix is that OKC has young players who make up good salaries and a lot of picks to exchange for Caruso.\n",

    "It's also worth noting that this is only for right now. The trade deadline can hit and different teams will enter the picture for the Bulls."
