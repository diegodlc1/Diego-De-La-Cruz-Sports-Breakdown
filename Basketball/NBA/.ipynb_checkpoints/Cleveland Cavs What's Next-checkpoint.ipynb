On top of that, the Cavs are over the Cap so they don't have free range of free agency however they hold restricted bird rights of Okoro.\n",

    "Isaac Okoro is eligible for an 11.8 million dollar qualifying offer next year. This puts him slightly above Chris Boucher and just below Herb Jones. Isaac Okoro is only 23 and I believe a solid player. Putting up a stat line of 9.4 ppg, 3.0 bpg, and 1.9 apg for the 6-5 SF. The only major dip from last year was his FT%, I think at 23 years old he has enough time to grow. With Okoro also being a restricted Free Agent, the Cavs can match any offer after offering the 11.8 million. I think he can get an offer worth more than the 11.8 million. Yes, he is only the 7th or 8th man on the bench, and paying someone in that position in the 8-figure range is a lot, however, he is still young. Do I think that the Cavs should match the offer? Possibly. It's going to depend on need and what other options may be available in free agency. I will come back to Okoro later since I will break down options in what the Cavs can do."

I would say a 2+1 year contract with a player option worth at most 40.5 million is a potential offer at this point. This contract would be only be if he had a successful year.

Jones may get paid more than 12.2 million and he's starting already so he might not take a backup role. O'Neal would be a good pick however he is older than Okoro and thus not worth it.

    "I like the first trade and the 3rd trade the most. However, if I'm the Cavs I'm choosing the first trade. The starting 5 looks the best for both teams that way and they fulfill a need. The expiring from Ingram is nice to have to see if he works and if he doesn't you let him go next year and the Pelicans get the starting PG that they desperately need. These is the backups for both teams\n",

Daniels is also younger and I think that the Cavs would rather have that than a 32-year-old backup Center. I also think that the Cavs need a backup point guard more than any other position outside of an SF and Daniels provides that. Only a lottery Protected first is needed to offset the one year remaining on Ingram as well as the upgrade from Nance to Daniels in potential. I think Merrill can be a backup SG only weakness is the front court.\n",

I think the Pelicans would have a hole at SF if Jones was moved so going with an expiring Nance Jr. paired with Strus should match Collins' value. I think that it looks fine. The main question in this is if the Jazz want to take a low-level starter and back up Center for Collins. He was only worth a second and Rudy Gay so maybe this is an increase in value. This gives the Jazz some cap space from Nance Jr. next year, getting an OK contract from Strus and maybe building around what they have. They could do this to tank as well since next year's draft is looking good. The other question is if this is enough value for Allen, Garland, and Strus. I don't think so, I think that a lottery-protected first should move the needle for the Cavs. I think that you could maybe add an extra first but let's stick to just one. This is the value given up.\n",
