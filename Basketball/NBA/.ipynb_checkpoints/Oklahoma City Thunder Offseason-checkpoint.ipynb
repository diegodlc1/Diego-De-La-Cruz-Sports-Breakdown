    "With the young Thunder team falling to the Dallas Mavericks 4-2 in the playoffs I wanted to take some time to breakdown this team for next year. Taking a huge step from playing in the play in last year to being the first team in the West this year, the team has a bright future ahead of them. With that I'm going to breakdown this team for the offseason."

Hopefully, he will perform well at the start of next year to regain some value again so he can get traded at the deadline to a tanking team looking to get his bird or a contending team to get a pure shooter for the second half of the year.

Knowing that the reason that the Thunder got eliminated is due to rebounding I think that they need to spend more in the PF/C options. I think that Claxton isn't the answer. He is too skinny being built like another Chet. If Claxton can get stronger then he could be a solid pickup, but the Thunder need a player for who they are now to compete in the now. I think that Anderson is solid but not worth a huge contract. This leaves Siakam and Hartenstein. I think that due to age and honestly fit, Hartenstein should get the shout. He will be cheaper than Siakam and would be a great fit on this Thunder team. With this, I think that the Thunder will have some money to splash for another starter or get a solid backup. I think that they should try and get a solid backup up and I think a Valucuinas or Harris would be a good fit if they accept a role on the bench. I think Toppin would be a good try to get and would be a solid fit on this team as well.\n",

A tanking team would take a young expiring contract for the extra 8.3 million dollars, or they would have rights to resign him. A rebuilding team would take a 22-year-old that played a decent amount of minutes in the playoffs. I think the market is good for him and he doesn't fit the OKC play style.

    "I think that a major signing needs to be made. I think that the player should be Isiah Hartenstein. He is not a huge name, however, his performance in the playoffs this past year shows that he can perform at the highest level as well as being young and a big body. The Knicks will offer 10.6 million for the qualifying but he should test the market since I believe the Thunder will pay more. Hartenstein is the player the Thunder needs, a big Center that can play inside with Chet being the stretch big that he is. I'm not worried about spacing with this duo. This is the contract I think he should receive:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hartenstein: 4-year, 112 Million Dollar contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good deal as he is young and securing a 4 year deal would be important for Hartenstein to guarantee 4 years of play. I think that he is worth around 28 million a year looking at other contracts, this should reflect on his talent and potential at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the Thunder would still have around 17 million left to spend until they hit the cap. A backup big would be necessary. Here are the most likely candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patrick Williams, Obi Toppin, Richaun Holmes, Andre Drummond, Precious Achiuwa\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the current squad, I ask if would I rather have Jaylin Williams in the 10-man or Kenrich Williams. Due to contracts, I would rather have Kenrich to maybe increase his value a little bit before the deadline. With that being said a Center would be needed. Drummond and Holmes would be the 2 options. Holmes has an 11.6 million dollar player option which I think he'll take. This leaves Drummond who I think would be a great fit for this team. This would be the contract I would give:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drummond: 3 years, with a team option, 24 million, and 16 million guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this contract, we filled in 9 positions in the starting 10 and I can see a Giddey trade for a Power Forward if a trade were to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the 3 on the trade block, Giddey is the only one with value. Kenrich would need a first-round pick attached to send his contract out. Jaylin Williams has no value except for being a young player and salary filler. As I mentioned before, Giddey would have an interest in all different types of teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this offseason, I don't think that he needs to be traded. Get an undrafted free agent, run with the team you have now, and wait until the deadline to make the move. More teams will see where they're at and make the necessary moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I think I can see a potential trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thunder Recieve: Precious Achiuwa\n",
    "\n",
    "Knicks Recieve: Josh Giddey in a Sign and Trade\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knicks free up around 5 million in salary and the Thunder have 9 million dollars to take back. The Knicks also get a young pure scorer while the Thunder receive a young Power Forward to come off the bench. This could free up cap space next year if the Knicks don't like Giddey. Again I don't think that this is necessary but if a trade were to happen, I can see this one being the move. This would leave a team like this\n",
