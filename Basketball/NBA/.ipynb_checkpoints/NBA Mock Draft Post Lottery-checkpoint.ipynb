    "The Hawks get lucky in the lottery and jump to the number one pick in this year's draft. Unlucky for them this is one of the weakest drafts in this century. However, this draft is key in getting role players and building a team which I believe is the meta for the NBA. With that being said Sarr is a top draft pick in this class. A defensive big that has a good offensive base is something the Hawks need. The team lacks a Power Forward and Sarr should be able to pair up with the front court and Capela and Bogdanovic to make up a solid frontcourt. If I were doing trades the Hawks could try to trade this to get a player to help now, however, I don't think there is much of a market. I think with this pick the Hawks won't make a move with Young or Murray, I can see a trade with Capela or Okongwu coming now that they have a top pick that plays similarly to both players."

To me the player with the highest upside the Wizards needs help everywhere and needs to take a chance on the player in the draft with the best potential, to me that is Risacher. The highest Boom-Bust player the Wizards takes the raw scorer and tries to make him into something. While Risacher currently isn't the best player in the draft, he is the one who can pan out to be the best player from this draft. The Wizards are in a bad position and they need to take a chance on this situation, this is the chance to take."

Putting up 22.7 ppg in 62 games in only his 3rd year, I can see him being that player. I'm still high on Ivey and Duran, I believe that the Pistons need a Defensive Forward who can help Duran and the team defensively, while not taking many touches from Cunningham and Ivey. Holland is that player and I believe he goes 5th."

The reason I think that Dillingham isn't a lottery pick is that there aren't that many teams in need of a point guard. I see the Wizards and Jazz being the only 2 teams in need of one, with the Wizards probably going BPA as they're in dire need of every position. I see the Rockets, Spurs, Thunder, and possibly Kings being potential teams picking a point guard, however, the Spurs don't desperately need one this year. The Rockets would pick one if it's the best selection at the moment, however, Risacher could drop and he would be a better selection. The Thunder and Kings need an SGA/Fox backup, however, I believe they need a backup in all positions. With that, I only really see 2 teams picking a point guard and Topic and Castle are the best fits for those respective teams.\n",
