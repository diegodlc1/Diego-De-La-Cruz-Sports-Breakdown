    "The Warriors have traded Thompson, a second round pick swap to get Hield, Anderson, and 1 pick. This is amazing business that has been done for the Warriors. I think that Thompson is washed. I don't think that he's not going to be good anymore and honestly it was addition by subtraction with him. The Warriors getting a solid contributer in Anderson and Hield, who adds depth for the title chasing Warriors is a great deal for Thompson. The pick swap and the pick doesn't matter that cancels out. The issue I have is the length on both of their contracts. Heild and Anderson are 31 and 30 respectively and have recieved a 4-year and 3-year deal. Now the money per year isn't horrible, around 9 million for each for the years, I think that the year length is what is rubbing me the wrong way as they are on the decline end of their careers. With that being said I still love the trade for Golden State."

    "The T-Wolves traded Kyle Anderson for a second round swap and Cash. It's a fine trade. The T-Wolves don't want to pay Anderson and I don't blame them. He was possibly the 9th best player on their team last year and the Timberwolves thought that they don't want to go deeper in the tax to bring him back. Getting a second round pick swap and cash back is whatever, a sign and trade doesn't warrant a huge return, but I feel like they could've gotten more out of that deal."

    "The Sixers gave up Hield for a second round pick from Dallas. That's a terrible trade. I feel like the price that Golden State was able to get him for would be worth it for a team like the Sixers. Maybe they don't think that he'll fit the roster with PG, Embiid, and Maxey, but I think that when you have some space, Hield for 9 million a year would be fine for the Sixers. Getting only a second is worse. I feel like you could've gotten 2 seconds even in a sign and trade deal, even cash, but it is what it is for this deal."

Green was a solid player for the Mavs during their Finals run, and he's young that going to a team like Charlotte will give him an elevated role with the Honets. With that being said he is currently being overpayed, but I think that his contract will be worth it after this year. Great trade for the Hornets in whole."

    "Dallas received Klay Thompson for Josh Green and a Second Round Pick. I think that this is a terrible trade for the Mavericks. I believe this for 2 reasons. I think that Green would be better than Thompson over the next 3 years. I think that keeping Green would be more impactful than getting Thompson. I also believe that the Mavs could've gotten a better player than Thompson to make the push to win the title now. I think Thompson isn't good anymore, and won't change with his time with the Mavs. I feel like the Mavs could've gotten someone like Kuzma or Grant who I think could be a better player than Thompson would be. This is a terrible trade that has set the Mavs back from title contention and they won't win it in the Kyrie window."

    "The Hornets are the winners in this trade without a doubt. I love this trade for them. They gave up a second for possibly the best player that is involved in this trade for the long run. I think that Josh Green has potential and getting him for only a second is crazy. You could argue that he is overpayed currently but honestly I think it will look like at value next year and a bargain in 2 years for the Hornets. Golden State gets a B+ for giving up Thompson and getting a solid return for him, hwoever I knocked down a couple of grades for the length of the contract. Still a great trade for the Warriors to contend. Minnesota and Philadelphia gets similar grades for the same reason, giving up players for just seconds. With that being said I gave Minnesota a better grade than Philadelphia because I feel like it's more understandable for the T-Wolves to not go deeper in the tax for Anderson and got a way better return than Philadelphia for a much worse player. I gave Dallas an F because they shut their Championship window by going after Thompson and giving up Josh Green and a second to do that. It's a terrible trade for them and Dallas is out of the Championship window.\n",

    "I think that Golden State isn't done with player movement. I think we'll see them trade on of their young guys, or more, to cut their playable roster size and get a younger superstar player in return. I think that everyone else is set in stone with the exception of Charlotte, they might make a push for a player. Sixers will play free agency, Minnesota is in second apron hell, and Dallas will feel like they made the move necessary this year. Charlotte might make some moves but I'm more confident in Golden State making the move. \n",

    "A Golden State trade would involve Moody and Gary Payton and the Warriors would look to aggregate these salaries for a Center. I think Larry Nance Jr. would be an interesting pick up from Atlanta, Olynyk from Toronto, Holmes from Washington, and Collins from San Antonio would all be interesting players that the Warriors could trade for."
