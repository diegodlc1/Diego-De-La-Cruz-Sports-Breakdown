He had a great season, and unless he wants to sacrifice money to compete, then he should stay, but at 29 he's leaving around 6-8 million for next year, and possibly future years, on the table. He should reject the option and test free agency, on top of the idea that Flagg takes his place. The Sixers have 13 players making 184.021 for next season."

    "This leaves only the MLE and 3 players who deserve to be paid. Yabu, Grimes, and Oubre are all worthy of a second contract. Yabu and Oubre will have non-bird rights, and Grimes is an RFA with full-bird rights. Yabu deserves around 10 million, Oubre deserves around 14-16 million, and Grimes is tougher to gauge, but I'm expecting a 14-16 million dollar contract for him. The issue arises in that Yabu can be offered 2.505, Oubre can be offered 9.579, and Grimes can be offered 8.593. I only expect one of them to be offered a contract to the Sixers based on the numbers. Assuming that Grimes was traded for midseason when they were essentially out of the playoff race, I'm assuming a deal was struck between the Sixers and Grimes to sign the MLE. I think Grimes will receive the full MLE, putting them at 14 players at 198.126 million next year. This puts the Sixers over the first apron with some flexibility to make one major move at some point during the season/offseason."

    "The Sixers have one spot left on the roster for a free agent on a minimum contract. Truthfully, they need to look for a PG or PF in this scenario. To throw some names: Monte Morris, Larry Nance Jr., Taurean Prince, Jae'Sean Tate. I think they would be able to grab a premium min option due to the time they're offering and getting Flagg. An undrafted free agent is another option. It'll depend on what they want to do in that case. We'll say that they get a player like that. \n",

    "Trade-wise, there is not much that can be done. A starting lineup of Maxey, Grimes, Flagg, PG13, and Embiid is solid enough to start the season with. No need to make massive changes to the starting lineup. The Sixers can use some of their depth contracts to try and get a backup PG or PF, but honestly, I would just run it with what they got this year. See where you're at and make a trade midseason. They should and will make a trade midseason, but at the moment I don't see much that can be moved."
