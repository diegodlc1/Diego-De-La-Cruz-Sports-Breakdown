While Newell hasn't proved much from that end, there is a higher chance that Newell can develop in that end. It'll be a solid pick for him to learn from Williams and Collins to try and develop that position. The second rounder isn't going to be worth a roster spot with the cap space to work with."

    "The Bulls have 2 expiring contracts. Josh Giddey and Tre Jones. They have both been traded for in the past year, and based on what they have done with the Bulls, they both should be extended. Giddey is a restricted free agent, and the Bulls should match everything. I think that the max he will go will be 30 million from the Bulls. He's eligible to reach the 38,661,750 full-bird number, however, he's not in the tier of Cade, Scottie, and Franz. I think 30 million a year is more than fair for Giddey. I would say between that and 32.500 million is the limit I put on Giddey. If another team (Brooklyn) wants to offer more, let them, but he's not worth more than 32.500. Tre Jones had a great turnaround with the Bulls. While he won't be making the same money as he did the previous season. Giving him something around the 3 million mark will do well. He had a terrible time with the Spurs but showed a turnaround with the Bulls. Will another team gamble for him, maybe, but the Bulls should match any offer and be able to retain him. 3-5 million is around the market price I see with Tre Jones, but I'm leaning more to the 3 million. 33 million cap hit coming next season."

    "The Bulls have 167.877 million dollars coming in for 14 players. Now it's time for the real magic to happen. The Bulls are in an interesting situation. They will have a lot of cap space coming into the following season. This team isn't going anywhere at the moment. They most likely won't make the playoffs again, they won't have a top draft pick, and the only thing going for them is the massive cap space the following season. Truthfully, the team should tank. This offseason, they need to trade everyone over the age of 25. Lonzo, Vuc, Huerter, Collins, and Carter should all be looked at to be traded. Carter isn't going to get any value back, so he's probably staying, but everyone else should be available. Truthfully, all of these players have value. They're all on expiring deals, so any playoff team is only taking a one-year risk on these players and retaining the salary if successful. If I'm the Bulls, I'm only looking for young players and picks. With that being said, let's see what happens here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vuc- I only see 4 teams that might pursue him. Lakers, Warriors, Celtics, Kings. Truthfully, the Kings shouldn't as they'll form the Bulls of the west, however, they might look to make a playoff push at the moment and have a hole at Center. I'm not going to say the Kings only for that reason, but they might pursue him. The other 3 make sense. The Warriors and Lakers need a Center. If the rumors are true, the Celtics will look to lower their tax bill this offseason and take on smaller contracts. It's going to be the Warriors. The Lakers and Celtics can't match the salary that the Bulls care about unless they overpay by a lot. The Warriors have the players and timeline to make the push to sign Vuc. Moodey plus Tracey Jackson-Davis is enough to make the deal happen. No picks added. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collins- Will draw interest from the top 3 mentioned above, however, he has less value than Vuc, so all teams outside of the Kings will look at him, and he was part of a Kings deal last year, if they wanted him, they would've sent something to get him last year. Outside of that, the Pistons, Clippers, Suns, and maybe the Raptors are options. Isaiah Stewart is probably the best the Bulls can get from any of these teams. Collins plus a pick or 2 could be enough to make up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huerter- I see the Spurs (Huerter), Rockets(Both), Raptors, Pelicans (Huerter), Sixers(Both?), and Magic(Huerter) are all options. I'll let the Raptors go since I don't see them going after Huerter. The other teams will go after Huerter, with the Sixers and Rockets looking at both. Truthfully, I don't see much between these teams for Huerter. At best, it's Jonathan Isaac. I don't see him having much value in the league outside of Isaac. Honestly, I would keep Huerter for now; no point in getting Isaac.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lonzo- Jabari Smith Jr., Lonzo, and 2 seconds should be enough to get Jabari Smith. The Rockets need a backup PG, and Lonzo is that player. The Smith Jr. Experiment is over, so give him to the Bulls to see if he can prove himself there.\n",
