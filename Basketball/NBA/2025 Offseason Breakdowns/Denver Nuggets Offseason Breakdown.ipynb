    "Let's get some of the easier options out of the way. Braun, Strawther, and Watson will have their player options picked up. They're young and were solid enough as depth pieces for the Nuggets to pick up their options. Gordon and Saric will pick up their options, too. Saric won't get that money in the open market, and Gordon has signed an extension with the intention to pick up his option this upcoming season. Westbrook will not pick up his option. I think that he can pull a bigger contract, around 8-10 million, from a different team that has the MLE to use. Now, the PG market is decently deep this year, but a good number of teams will be looking for PG depth, so I believe he'll join a team for that price."

    "This is where it gets interesting. The Nuggets need to make changes to capitalize on what is left in Jokic's career. They're a first-apron team, so they only have the TPMLE to work with. The TPMLE and no major draft pick aren't enough to make that final push past the second round. On top of the main core getting older, the Nuggets would have to hope that all of the young depth pieces develop more; that's a lot to ask. Truthfully, the Nuggets need to look for a trade first. Jokic, Murray, and Braun are the only players protected from a trade. With that, we can eliminate other players. Saric and Nnaji have no market. Strawther and Watson shouldn't be traded unless it's an upgrade the Nuggets need. Pickett and Tyson don't have much value. I think everyone knows that MPJ and Jamal Murray are the 2 most tradeable pieces the Nuggets have. With that being said, let's take a look around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with moving MPJ. He will get a PG on a smaller contract. They could add Nnaji at the minimum, but they need to take on a contract of less value. Making a trade to a team looking to move from a PG to an SF. I see 5 options. Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Jalen Suggs, Dejounte Murray, and CJ McCollum. Looking at these options, let's start breaking this down. Morant isn't going for MPJ and filler, and the Grizzlies won't take that offer. The Pelicans and Magic don't have space in the frontcourt to take on MPJ unless they move Franz, Paolo, Zion, or Murphy. I don't see that. Fox makes some sense. The Spurs have Harper and Castle now. That's a solid backcourt for the future, and moving Fox for a solid piece in MPJ makes some sense. Looking at other possible teams are the Pistons and possibly the Jazz. Pistons can offer Ivey, Thompson, and Stewart for MPJ. The Jazz can give Collins and George to MPJ. Between all of these teams, I'll make a trade with the Pistons. The reason is to shed salary below the first apron to take on KD. This leaves the Jazz and Pistons. The Pistons would be the most logical answer. I don't think the Jazz would take on MPJ's contract. Now, would the Pistons take on MPJ? Not for that cost. They would look to move Harris, but this is the most likely scenario for MPJ. This deal makes sense. I think Stewart is overpaid, Ivey is coming off a major injury, and Holland or Thompson will be solid role players at their peaks. MPJ can be a great third option on a team, and with more being open, they can make some good moves to add players in the future. Add picks however you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add KD. This is who the Nuggets should be targeting. Considering the top trade happens, the Nuggets will be below the first apron, but would need a third team, as I highly doubt the Suns want Nnaji and Murray to be the return for KD. Knowing this, let's look at teams that would take Murray, Saric, and Watson. Magic, Heat, Wolves, Kings, and Mavs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that for all trades, the Nuggets only get KD unless otherwise stated.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this, I would drop the Kings and T-Wolves as Wolves won't do that deal, and the Suns won't do the other deal. I'll drop the Magic as well since Suggs is younger than Murray and fits the Magic timeline better. This leaves the Heat and Mavs. Truthfully, the Mavs deal is the best. They would have to do this before the draft, as Flagg would put them over the second apron, but Murray would be a great addition for the Mavs, and the Suns get Watson and Gafford to build with. This adds .802 million to the cap.\n",

    "This means the Nuggets have 14 players for 194.659. They can get Brogdon as a great player for part of the MLE. This would work the best and fill out the Nuggets as a second apron team (if Westbrook doesn't re-sign)."
