    "The Clippers have ended a somewhat successful season. They were able to have Kawhi back for a good amount of games, and James Harden has elevated his play to show that he is still a top player in the league. With that being said, the Clippers have to look to improve along the margins to make a push for a title chance in the coming seasons."

While he needs to polish his offensive game for the NBA level, the Clippers could use Thiero as a PF with Batum's age catching up to him and Kobe Brown being a disappointment. The Clippers will gladly take him in the first. I've put the 2 second rounders as Two-Way players but I will change that if need be in the future."

Kobe Brown is interesting in that he has shown much of anything in his first 2 years, but a guaranteed player for somewhat being cheap is nice. I'll keep this open until the free agency and trade section before doing anything with this option. Harden will probably decline his option. He's going to resign with the Clippers but will look for either a longer contract or try and get more money from this year. We will see."

    "The Clippers have 4 extensions at this point. Harden, Coffey, Mills, and Simmons all need an extension. I think Harden could take a small discount this year, 34 million a year for 2 years, plus a player option. Lost out on 2 million to guarantee 34 the next season, worth it for a player his age. Mills is done, he's washed. Simmons would be worth it on a minimum contract. A 2-year minimum contract at 3.303 million dollars with a player option for the following season is solid for Simmons. Then we have Coffey. I'm high on Coffey. He's shown that he can be a reliable player for the Clippers, and they have his full bird rights. I think you can get him for a 3-year 12 million extension, as I don't think another team will blow their full MLE on him unless I'm mistaken. If that's the case, then I would let them if I'm the Clippers, but truthfully, the SG market is pretty rich this year with the demand for an SG low. I don't think that he'll pull a big contract in this market. After all of these moves, the Clippers are at 14 players for 185.788 million."

    "The Clippers have the full MLE to work with, and I think they would look to improve the frontcourt with the MLE. Guerschon Yabusele is who they will look to get. The Clippers won't have enough money to get Kuminga, and everyone else is out of reach. It'll also be tough for the Sixers to keep Yabu and Oubre, as it'll be one or the other. While it could be possible, promising a starting spot for the same money the Sixers can offer would be enough to pull him from the Sixers. It'll probably have to be around 12-14 million, which I think is an overpay as Yabu is a 10-11 million dollar player, but to compete with the Sixers, that's what would need to happen. I'll give them Yabu for the at best 12 million, but expect it to be even more. 15 players for 197.788 million. Well above the first apron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sixers need to look to make a trade to get under the first apron. At this point, they're hard capped at the first apron, so a salary dump will be necessary. I think Bogdanovic and Batum with a pick can get something to shed around 4.5 million in cap space to get Brown back on the roster for his option and stay under the first apron. The Clippers need to look for a backup big to have as a bench option for when Zubac needs to come off. I actually think that these players would have a solid market, at least better than what most people would suspect. Bogdanovic has a skillset that most teams would like, and if he's still not the same player, they have the option to decline his player option next year. Batum is a negative except for being an expiring that can open around 5 million in cap space and add a bench defender/veteran presence for this coming season. The added pick can help sway a team to make this trade. This is an Orlando special. The Magic would love to have a shooter like Bogdanovic to see what he has. They have Mo Wagner, Jonathan Isaac, and Wendell Carter Jr. being options. Gafford is another option for Dallas, who would look to compete with a hole at SG that Bogdanovic can fill, unless they shift Klay to the 2. Olynyk, Robert Williams, Richaun Holmes, Mitchell Robinson, and Jonas Valanciunas are all options as well. I think that Orlando, Washington, and New York are all the best options, considering what each team would want. If New York wants a shooter, they would accept this trade, but I think that they're doing fine in that department and won't be needed. While Dallas wouldn't mind Bogdanovic as a fit, I think they can get more for Gafford than Bogdanovic and a pick. New Orleans, Sacramento, and Portland don't need an SG in their current state. It's purely going to be Washington and Orlando. Isaac is the only option for the Magic due to cap reasons. Between Isaac and Holmes, I'm taking Holmes. Washington can take on the cap hit and vet presence as they're not looking to compete next season anyway. Hopefully, they regain their value and flip them at the deadline. This should cut 7.6 million for the cap, and the Clippers pick up Brown's option at 2.655 million. 15 players at 192.843 million dollars.\n",
