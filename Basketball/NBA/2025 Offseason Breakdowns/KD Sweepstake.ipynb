The issue with this is that KD will convolute the front court. KD, Paolo, and Franz are all Forwards. The spacing would be terrible and convoluted. Another issue is that a 3rd team would be needed to make the trade happen to take on contracts and such. The assets are fine, but truthfully, Suggs would be the only player that the Suns will keep; KCP and Isaac are being rerouted to another team. Suggs is coming off an injury-riddled year, and KCP had one of his worst years to commend a team trading much to the Suns to route him in. Isaac could pull the bigger asset to Phoenix but it'll be tough to make money work then. In total I would give this a 15/30 trade destination."

    "The Nuggets are in an ugly situation. They have little depth, so they will have to give up a starting point guard without a new one to come in to bring in KD. MPJ's contract is too small to move for KD, so you have KD and a less efficient, younger KD on the same team. At the same time, KD will raise Denver's floor. The main question is whether KD and Russ can be on the same team together. If Nnaji can be moved, or will it require giving up young depth like Holmes and Watson instead? I don't think Phoenix wants Murray, but if they don't get their picks back from Houston, then I can see Murray going to Phoenix. Not sure if this is worth it for either team, but if Houston doesn't give up the Suns' picks, then I can see Murray being a fine target to stay floating. I will give it a 16.5/30 destination at the moment, but this can rise if the Rockets keep the Suns' picks."

While I like Desmond Bane as a player, you trade him for KD 10/10 times. KD fits the scheme Memphis is trying to run. He fits in at the hole at SF that Memphis needs to fill. Granted, the SG position is taking a downgrade, Jaylen Wells can be moved to develop in that position for Memphis. KD fills a need, is a great option next to Morant and JJJ. They're not giving too much, and Phoenix will gladly take what they're giving in Jackson and Bane. If Houston isn't giving picks back to Phoenix, Bane is a solid player to keep them floating, and the potential of Edey coming too is all intriguing for Phoenix to make moves. 23/30 trade destination."

I don't think that they move Maxey either but it's the move that makes the most sense for both sides. If KD ends up with the Sixers, it would have to involve a 3rd team.

It'll free cap space the following season if it fails, and hopefully that helps the Knicks for the next season.

I think it's a fine loss for return, maybe adding Jaquez and dropping a pick. Other than that it doesn't make much sense. The Heat are in a weird purgatory stage and KD doesn't make sense for them unless Wiggins is part of the deal, and I don't think the Suns want Wiggins. 20/30"

The only issue is that the frontcourt for the Jazz would be convoluted. John Collins would have to be moved for a starting PG to make the fit better.
