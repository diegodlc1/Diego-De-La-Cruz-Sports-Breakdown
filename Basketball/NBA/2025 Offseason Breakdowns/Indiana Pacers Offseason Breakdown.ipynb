    "The Pacers came close. Taking the Thunder to Game 7 but falling short due to the Achilles tear of Tyrese Haliburton. With that being said, I want to take some time to break down the Pacers' offseason. I had a clear idea before Game 7 that if they lost, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I am now at a loss. With that being said, we'll move forward from here, and I'll try to break down their offseason."

    "The Pacers traded their first-round pick for this draft. They had it coming into Game 7; however, they made a trade with the Pelicans, giving that pick for their own 2026 pick back. With Tyrese going down, I would've wished to keep the pick, but we couldn't predict that happening with 100% certainty. Other than that, the Pacers have a second, but I don't think they'll get more than a 2-way. I'll change this down below if I feel otherwise.\n",

    "This is where it gets interesting for the Pacers. Turner needs to get an extension, no matter what. The Pacers have his full Bird rights and can give him a contract of any length and amount that matches up to 35% of the salary cap. I don't think he's going to be worth that money, so I won't give him that. It's kinda hard to quantify the amount Indiana will give him. I think giving him a 30-million-dollar AAV contract coming into next season would be fair for his value. It's a solid payday for him, and to me, it best represents the value that I think he's worth. Between 25-30 million, depending on the length of the contract. However, it's such a large contract. Giving 25 million for 4 years instead of 30 million for 3 is probably the best option. Let's give Turner the 25 million. Now, the next question is whether they pay Isaiah Jackson. If they do it, won't it be for a large contract, but will the Pacers continue to take a chance on him? I think they should. I don't think the extension would be that big. Something around the 4-5 million dollar range on a 2-year deal will be fine. I'll give him a 4.5 million for that reason. Continue to take a chance on him and hope that he recovers. We can let Bryant walk, and Johnson would sign for the vet minimum if there is a spot for him when we do this offseason."

    "In this scenario, the Pacers are above the first apron at 197.443 million. They only have the TPMLE to work with in this scenario. Haliburton is out until late February at the earliest, late April at the longest. I don't think that they'll be eligible for a DPE, as there is a possibility that Haliburton can play before June 15th. It's very tough to say the extent of the injury, and we've seen Klay and KD not play a whole year, but Kobe came back in 8 months. It is hard to predict what the board decides in this situation. I won't give it to them as Tyrese is still young and will be back around March or April. The Pacers should be good enough to make the playoffs, and he should be available for the playoffs. I could be wrong, of course, but it just makes the most sense that this is the reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of this, we'll play out what the Pacers do. At first, I thought that if they lost, they needed to get Trey Murphy from the Pelicans. They still can, but I see less of an incentive to do so, as I think they can still beat the Thunder when they do have Tyrese. I thought that a subtle improvement at the wing would be enough to bolster them as a Championship team. When Tyrese went down, we didn't know what this team could have done if it were healthy. Running it back with Tyrese not being injured is the best option at the moment. They can make a massive trade at the deadline depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacers just need to use the full TPMLE to get a Point Guard or another Wing in the best-case scenario. I think a PG is the most likely scenario. Micic, Fultz, Dinwiddie, Exum, maybe Brogdon if he doesn't pull the number he's probably looking for. It's really tough to call what will happen in this case, but those at the top name for that money. Someone could be more of a ring chaser and take on less money than what they can get, like Westbrook, Chris Paul, or DLo. Highly doubt they make the move for that money, but who knows? Other than that, the other spot can be filled by a veteran minimum like Johnson or someone else. These numbers add up to around 205.424, a couple of million off from the second apron.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, I wouldn't look for a trade. I get being scared to pay Mathurine, however, you don't make massive changes with a Finals team when the reason you lost is that your second-best player got injured. Run it back with what you have and make the trade at the deadline if you're concerned about what is happening or have more certainty on what is going on. That is my breakdown for the Indiana Pacers."
