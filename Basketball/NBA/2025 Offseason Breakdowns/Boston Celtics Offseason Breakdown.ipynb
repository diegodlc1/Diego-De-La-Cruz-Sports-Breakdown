    "The Celtics are a second-apron team. They're deep in the tax for next season, and we know that they're looking to cut salaries. They can't aggregate salaries or take on more salary than what they send out. The Celtics will also have a Disabled Player exception with the Tatum injury. They don't have any more exceptions and can only sign minimum contracts or their free agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I start any of this, I want to figure out what the Celtics need to plan for next season. The Celtics aren't a championship team next year unless they keep the same core they have this year. The thought is to keep the same roster with their salaries and add the DPE, and try to compete. The issue is that they weren't going to win it if they did that. They didn't win this year with Tatum, and they won't win it without him. The DPE won't give the Celtics a player of Tatum's skill set. this is a retool year, and the Celtics need to cut the money to prepare for when Tatum comes back. I don't know how much they want to cut, but it'll be tough to cut to the second apron limit even with the tradeable players they have. With that being said, let's talk about Porzingis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poraingis is the most likely candidate at the moment to be traded. He only has one year left on his deal, and with Tatum out for next season, they need to look to cut salary for next season and get a player for when Tatum comes back. A competing team in need of frontcourt help and under the apron teams would be the best landing spot for Porzingis. Pistons, Heat, Bulls, Hawks, Rockets, Lakers, Clippers, Warriors, Grizzlies, Kings, Suns, Spurs, and Pelicans can all be possible landing spots based on their aspirations. I'll eliminate the Bulls and Pelicans due to competing reasons. I'll eliminate the Suns due to salaries, and this leaves the Pistons, Heat, Rockets, Lakers, Clippers, Warriors, Grizzlies, Kings, and Spurs. I think that the Celtics are expecting to get back depth pieces in this trade. At the minimum, they can bring back around 24.585 million. Taking back 2 solid bench players with an expiring salary filler would be the best for the Celtics. Knowing this, let's take a look at what each of these teams can offer. Pistons would have to offer Ivey, Holland/Thompson, and Fontecchio. Heat can do Robinson, Jaquez, and Highsmith. Rockets are Sheppard, Landale, and Whitmore. DFS, Kleber, and Knecht from the Lakers. Bogdanovic, Jones Jr., and Miller from the Clippers. Warriors have nothing unless it's a sign-and-trade involving Kuminga, which can't happen anyway. Clarke, Konchar, and Edey is the only realistic trade from the Grizzlies. Either Valanciunas, Murray, and LaRavia or Monk, LaRavia, and Jones from the Kings. Barnes, Wesley, and Champaign from the Spurs. I think the Pistons are giving too much for Porzingis, and I wouldn't do that if I were the Pistons. Out of all of the rest of the options, I would say the Heat has the best offer. I like Highsmith and Jaquez for depth the following year, and getting Robinson as an expiring would be huge for the cap the following season. This would cut 1.3 million for the following season. The Celtics can then try to trade Holiday away to cut salary even more for next season, but it'll be impossible to get under the second apron after the above trade. Heat, Nuggets, Clippers, T-Wolves, Kings, Mavs, and Suns are the main options. We can eliminate the Nuggets and Suns due to apron issues. The Celtics would need a starting Center and salary if needed. The Heat have Ware. Clippers have nothing. Reid on a sign-n-trade, which can't happen. Kings have Valanciunas. Dallas has Gafford. It would be Rozier and Ware from the Heat. Gafford and Thompson/Washington is Dallas' offer. Monk and Valanciunas is all that the Kings can offer. Looking at all of these I can see all teams having a strong case to make these deals. With a weak East next season, the Heat can have one of the best starting 5 in the league next season by making this trade, even if it means giving up Ware. Dallas can get a defensive-minded guard to compete with what they would have. The Kings can make this move to make a push. Truthfully, Holiday needs to be a 4th option on the offense to succeed, as well as going to a team that's close to a title. The Kings aren't close, I wouldn't understand making that trade. If Porzingis goes to the Heat, they can compete next season. With Flagg, the Mavs can compete as well. It's up to what the Celtics want to bring back. They're not saving much money from either team. Truthfully, I would take on the Heat offer again. The Celtics would have to extend Gafford next year, and they're not saving much money in the deal to do that. They'll be in the same place next year. Rozier would come off the books next season, and they would gladly take Ware's cheap contract for years to come. If I'm the Heat, I'm watching this Celtics offseason closely.\n",
