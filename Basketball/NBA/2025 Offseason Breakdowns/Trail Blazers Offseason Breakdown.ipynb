    "Jakucionis is an interesting prospect. He has the playmaking and scoring ability to be a great prospect for the NBA. The issues come from the defensive end of the ball. He gets caught in bad positions, and it leaves open shots. With a strong defensive backing behind him in Ayton, Clingan, and Williams, the Blazers would be a great landing spot for Jakucionis. There are a lot of question marks with the Blazers' backcourt, so he can see what he has for the Blazers."

He's still young and developing, but at some point, he needs to produce more than what his showing at the moment. While 10.748 million isn't awful for his production, and worth it with his age. He's regressed in all aspects except for efficiency from his rookie season. He's worth the option now, since I don't think that the Blazers need the 10 million for a different player.\n",

    "There are 2 expiring contracts. Banton and Walker. Banton is unrestricted with early-bird rights, and Walker is restricted with full-bird rights. This is interesting because I'm trying to gauge the value of Banton. On one side, he puts up numbers that would warrant a larger than 3.690 million hit on his early-bird rights. However, some numbers put him at the minimum value of contracts given to players in the league. Truthfully, if I'm the Blazers, I'm not giving Banton more than 3.690. They have Jakuciones and Scoot, so he would only be seen as the 3rd option. Do I think another team would offer more than that? Maybe. Truthfully, I think that he would get a bigger contract than that from another team. He would want a bigger contract than that, so unless the Blazers want to use some of their MLE, they would have to let him walk. They don't need him that bad so I will say to let him walk. Walker would be easier to retain. Restricted, Full-Bird, and will probably only pull a min-level contract from another team so the Blazers can match or even go up to 2.5 million. I don't see him going more than that. Add 2.5 million to the cap."

    "At this point, the Blazers are at around 173.994 million in cap with 13 players on their roster. They would still have the full MLE yet to spend in free agency to fill out the last 2 spots, however, I do believe a trade will happen with this lineup, but let's play out the free agent market. Truthfully, I'm making a push for Ben Simmons. He hasn't proved much, but I do feel like he can help with Scoot's or Jakuciones' development. I don't think he's worth a large chunk, but a more experienced PG at that age would be a great option. Another option is Dinwiddie or something along those lines. I think a minimum contract would be thrown for a PF. It could be an undrafted FA or an older player. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for trading. The Blazers have a lot of Center depth that could be traded away for more. All 3 players are serviceable centers, and adding more SF depth would be good. Truthfully, they can either take on a bad contract or get a younger player by attaching a pick or 2. Something like Knecht plus Vincent for him would make sense on all sides. This would drop the need for using free agency to grab a Guard and get the Lakers off of Vincen't awful contract. Addresses the need of Center for the Lakers at a minimum, but they would need to make a move for another Center due to Williams' injury history. Dillon Brooks could potentially be moved for Robert Williams, but it wouldn't make much sense for the Blazers to actively get him. We'll give them the Vincent and Knecht for Williams. Highly doubt the Lakers would really want that, but the Lakers do need a Center. They could also try and pursue Ayton with DFS and Hachimura plus picks, but they don't have the picks to take on that contract. It's tough to say but this would be the most logical thought process for the Blazers in the trade market."
