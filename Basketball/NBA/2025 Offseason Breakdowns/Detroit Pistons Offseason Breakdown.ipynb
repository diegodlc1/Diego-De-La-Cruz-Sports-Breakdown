    "The Pistons have finally broken through. All of these years, staying at the bottom of the league, the Detroit Pistons have made the playoffs. Cade looks like a superstar, and the Pistons have a lot of pieces to build around, develop, and even flip for the future. With that being said, we will do a breakdown of the Detroit Pistons."

    "The Pistons only own the Raptors' second-round pick. Looking at the possible lineups and depth chart, I think that they will sign the second-rounder a full contract. They only have 10 players on their roster, with 3 desirable free agents on expiring deals, the Pistons won't be able to retain most of them. The second-rounder will most likely be signed for a minimum deal.\n",

    "Now this is the biggest thing that the Pistons have to look at. THJ, Shroder, and Beasley are all up for extensions, and we need to look at them first. Looking at contracts and cap space, the Pistons have about 27.179 in cap space, plus the MLE to work with. They also have THJ's full bird, Shroder's early bird, and Beasley's non-bird. THJ and Shroder shouldn't get these numbers unless they were to sign a single-year deal with the Pistons with those bird contracts. Beasley can be worth around 22 million dollars a year. The only other teams that can try to get him at that pricetag are Brooklyn or Memphis. I don't think that he fits in the Brooklyn timeline, so it leaves Memphis or Detroit. I do think that if Detroit doesn't sign him for that, then Memphis will. I think Detroit bites the bullet and gets him for 22 million on a 3-year deal. This leaves 5.179 million plus the MLE to work with. Do I think that they can still get THJ or Shroder? Maybe. I also think that another team would give them both more money to join them from the MLE, and truthfully, the Pistons don't need them. Outside of this, we could see THJ or Shroder being kept on with a cheaper deal, but I think they can both pull more money from another team. Reed and Waters can be droppe for the moment as well."

    "The Pistons shouldn't make any massive trades this offseason; they can make a small one, but they don't need to make a massive move. They just made the playoffs, they need to see what they have next year with a healthy Ivey and then make a massive move the following offseason. Nothing crazy needs to be done right now. With that being said, they have a good amount of Cap space for a nice signing. They can pull Kuminga. Kuminga fits the timeline, a need, and can fit with the Pistons altogether to elevate the team. The Warriors want him gone, and the Pistons have the money to spend on him. They can outbid the Hawks, another team that would look at him, at around 19 million a year. This leaves 0.826 million left to be spent on top of a minimum contract or the Bi-Annual exception. The Pistons would have 13 players and still have 2 more roster spots. I think they can spend the rest of the MLE they have to add to get a premium minimum player. Someone like Elfried Payton, Markell Fultz, Kyle Lowry, Gary Harris, Kevon Looney, Luke Kornet, or Jericho Sims. Truthfully, they should use it for Elfried Payton. He would fit well on the Pistons as a creator and shouldn't pull a huge number from another team. This would be a solid landing spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "I see one trade option that the Pistons can and should pursue. Fontecchio and Sasser for Lonzo Ball. The Pistons could use the PG depth, and the Bulls shouldn't be thinking of competing this year. Fontecchio will add 8.3 million in cap space next season and give Sasser a chance to develop better in Chicago. Outside of this, the Pistons shouldn't be looking to make massive moves yet. They're like the Rockets, they don't need to make rash changes yet, and Lonzo has a team option if the Pistons want it or decline. Outside of this, they can fill out the rest of the roster with minimum contracts or Waters and Reed for Cheap contracts\n",
