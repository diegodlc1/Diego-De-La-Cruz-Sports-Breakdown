    "The Raptors are entering this season with changes already made that they don't know much about. With the addition of Brandon Ingram at the deadline, the Raptors may look to make a push into the playoffs. While this year hasn't proved much for them, the Raptors may look to make a push into the playoff picture this season. I want to play it out so this is the Raptors offseason breakdown."

    "The Raptors own 2 draft picks in the upcoming draft. They have their own first and the Blazers' second-round pick. The Raptors will look to upgrade their frontcourt through the draft to try and add depth behind what they already have after losing a lot of it this past season. With that being said, here's what I see.\n",

    "1. Derik Queen, 6.889 million for next season\n",
    "2. Second Round Pick, 1.273 million for next season\n",
    "\n",
    "Queen would fit nicely as a backup Center. Poeltl has that under lock for at least another season, if not another. Queen needs to adjust to the speed of the league, so a backup position would help in development. Other than that, he has a strong game, and I'm confident in his ability to be an offensive juggernaut. Based on how I'm planning this season out, I believe that the Raptors will sign their second-round pick to a contract. They need to fill out the roster and don't have much money to make major signings there. This will help fill out their roster. This adds 2 players for 8.162 million for next season."

The Raptors don't need to give him a contract for next season, and I believe that he's done playing in the league. Boucher is interesting. On one hand, I know the Raptors like him, and he likes the Raptors. On the other I'm not sure if Darko is a big fan of him. He played fewer minutes than a younger Mogbo but put up solid numbers when he was given chances. While I believe that if the Raptors are serious in contending, then giving a contract to Boucher would be worthwhile, you would have to give him the minutes to put up those numbers. I do believe another team would be serious in pursuing him and give him a bigger contract and role than what the Raptors would offer. Truthfully, I would sign Boucher to an extension if I were confirmed that Darko will play him as a second stringer. However, it seems like they want to go in the direction of Mogbo, so I would let Boucher go into free agency."

    "Ok, so the Raptors have one open roster spot with 10 million until they reach the first apron. The Raptors will be fine going over the first apron, so a trade will be made first since they would have fewer restrictions, then a free agent signing would be made after. With that being said, I can see a potential deal by combining Agbaji and Walter. Here is the list.\n",

    "Jonathan Isaac, Isiah Stewart, Daniel Gafford, Jordan Clarkson, Bobby Portis, Kelly Olynyk, Robert Williams, Richaun Holmes, Mitchell Robinson, Brandon Clarke, Donte DiVincenzo, Mooses Moody, Gabe Vincent, Keegan Murray, Mo Wagner, Wendell Carter Jr., Scoot Henderson, Reed Sheppard, TJ McConnell.\n",

    "I'll eliminate Isaac since everyone else would be expiring this year, whereas Isaac would have 4 years left on his contract. Derik Queen is the draft pick, and if he develops well, then Isaac would be too long and be worth less than what they gave up. The other 4 would give the Raptors more control. After deeper examination, I'll eliminate Clarkson and Portis. The Bucks don't have as much depth from the Center position, and Portis is a pseudo-center at best. Agbaji came from Utah, so I don't think that Utah wants him back at this point in their build. This leaves Gafford and Robinson. I think both of them would fit well into a build, and truthfully, they should look to go after Gafford. If the Raptors want to make a push, then Gafford would be a better backup than Robinson. The Mavs need some SG depth and a potential new shooter, so both of them fit that mold. After this, a PG and PF would be needed. They have the full MLE; however, they will be hard-capped above the second apron if they use all of it, and would be hard-capped above the first apron if they use above the TPMLE. They may use a min contract to give them more flexibility through the season, but it's tough to say. CP3 could be an option, and Schroder could be another option if they want to be hard-capped. Dinwiddie and Exum are good options as well. They need a backup who has experience to make a play-off push. If not, a min contract to PF would make the most sense for flexibility at the deadline."
