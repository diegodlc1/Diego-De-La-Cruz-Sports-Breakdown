    "The Milwaukee Bucks are currently in the most interesting position in the NBA. They're at the crossroads and need to pick a direction. Everything will rely on whether Giannis wants out or not. If he wants out, then there is one direction, and if he wants to stay, then there is another direction. As we don't know what is going to happen, so I will play this out how I think it will go. I will space this out differently than all of the other offseason breakdowns."

I want to address my own prediction before doing anything else with this breakdown. So what will happen? I don't think that he will be moved. If he wants out, this is the year to do it for both sides, and I don't think he'll ask out. I believe that he's loyal and will stay. We'll see what happens but I will go about doing this breakdown with Giannis staying."

    "Connaughton will pick up his option. He isn't going to pull that money as a player ever again, as he will pick up his option. I'll get another obvious player out of the way with Porter Jr. declining his option. He has shown to be worth more than the money he will get next year, and an interesting option is the Brooklyn Nets. Portis is interesting. On one hand, he can take this, and Milwaukee can give him a larger extension during the offseason, or he can decline his option, and Milwaukee extends him for less than what they would give if his option is extended. Milwaukee has his full bird rights and can match a lot of offers. If Giannis stays, then Portis is a Buck. In this scenario, he's staying, and if Atlanta doesn't want to offer Portis the 18.033 million they could have, then Portis will stay a Buck. To be safe, I will have Portis going for 18.5 million declining over the next 2 years with a player/team option in the third season. Porter would be harder to get back as he'll pull around 10-12 million in free agency, and the Bucks don't have any Bird rights on him."

    "There are 5 extensions. Sims and Rollins can be retained on minimum deals. Both players won't get much in the open market, but have shown flashes on the Bucks. Rolins is an RFA, and Bucks have Sims' full-bird rights. They won't get much in the market, and if a team wants them that much to overpay them, then let them. These 2 can go for the minimum contract. Out of the next 3, only GTJ would get an extension. Lopez isn't going to be worth the Bird Rights given, and I believe another team will overpay for what the Bucks would want to retain him for. I think Lopez will be gone from Milwaukee as he'll pull 10-12 million in free agency. Maybe Milwaukee will pay it, but I don't think the numbers really match up here. Prince is likely gone; he'll go for the minimum on a team with a higher chance at a title. GTJ is a good option for the Bucks. He'll go for 10-12 million as well, but this would have to go through the MLE since the Bucks only have his Early-Bird rights. We'll go from here down below."

    "The Bucks can probably keep GTJ and KPJ. The Bucks will most likely be able to get a Disabled Player Exception from the NBA for Lillard's injury, giving them another MLE. This can be spent on one of the 2, and the full MLE can be used for another. They both fit well in Milwaukee, and with Giannis staying, they have more reason to stay on the Bucks. This gives Milwaukee 15 players going at 198.043 million in cap space, above the first apron. Now we can get to trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bucks would need to make a trade to get under the first apron and improve in some holes. I think the most likely trade candidates in this scenario are Kuzma and AJ Green. I don't think Kuzma would pull much value from any team, and attaching a young asset in Green would make it intriguing. The Bucks need to cut 3 million and add an SF and a C. Orlando could be interested in Isaac. Carter Jr., or Goga, and Harris if Orlando picks up his option. Harris is a very negative asset, less so than Kuzma, with the only thing going for him being history and an expiring deal. Not sure if Milwaukee does this, as Harris is that bad of an asset, and Orlando needs to get under the first apron for this to happen. Other than that, they can go after just one player. Klay Thompson and Keldon Johnson could be realistic additions. Hachimura, Lu Dort, and Dillon Brooks are all more out there, but still possible. With Jarett Allen and Jakon Poeltl being pipe dreams, but semi-realistic. Out of all of these trades, Allen and Poeltl can be dropped as I mentioned pipe dreams. Keldon Johnson is iffy as well as I think Spurs have higher aspirations on a trade with him. Thunder don't need this trade either. All the other players could happen. I would say Orlando's deal is the most realistic and best for both teams with Brooks or Thompson being second. I'll say the Orlando deal probably works the best with Carter Jr. being the best Center to get."
