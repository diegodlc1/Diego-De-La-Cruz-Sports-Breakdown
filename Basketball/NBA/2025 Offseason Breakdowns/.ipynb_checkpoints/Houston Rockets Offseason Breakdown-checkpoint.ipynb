    "We are now in the playoffs. The Rockets have made the playoffs with their young core for the first time since the 2019-20 season. They have been near the bottom of the league for the last 4 years, and finally broke through this last year. With all of that being said, the Rockets are in an interesting position. Getting the second seed in the West but losing in the first round. With that being said, I'll play out the offseason to try and make a difference."

    "The Rockets already have Sengun, but they can add much-needed depth at the Center position with Maluach. I think that he is a solid big, and by not relying on being the main big is the best for his development. If he can prove he's a good prospect, then Sengun or Maluach can be used as a trade piece in the future. The second rounder is too far down, the timeline doesn't match, and the cap situation isn't great in accordance with what is wanted for this season. He gets a two-way."

    "Having the 9th pick puts them over the first apron if the Rockets were to keep every option. Looking at this, we can accept the easy options. Thompson, Eason, and Whitemore have their options picked up. They're playing more than what they're worth and deserve to be picked up. I think that Smith Jr. also gets his option picked up. I'm confused about how the Rockets played him in the playoffs, but he put up solid numbers during the regular season to warrant the option. I'll say his option gets picked up as well. I also think that VanVleet isn't worth his number, but for a playoff team in need of a PG and VanVleet is the best PG in the market, you pick up his option. He's worth 35-40 million next season, but to solidify him staying, you pick up his option. This leaves Aaron Holiday. The Rockets can keep him to only add the TPMLE, or they can drop him for the full MLE. Truthfully, you drop him. Get under the first apron and have more flexibility for a trade, or open the MLE. Subtract 4.901 from the cap."

    "The Rockets are in an interesting place for this free agency period. They can keep the lineup that they currently have and add with the MLE the needed positions, or they can make a trade and go from there. What would need to happen is that they need to make a huge trade and accept to get over the first or second apron. I think they need to look to get a trade first and combine 3 players to get 1 or 2 back. If the Rockets want Giannis, they would give Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., and Amen Thompson. Salary needs to match with only about 3 million in wiggle space, and nothing else matches. They can replace Green with Sengun, but I don't think that the Rockets would do that. This leaves the deal being the best for Giannis if the Rockets want to make it. Other than that, they can make a push for Michael Porter Jr. by giving the Nuggets much-needed depth with Jalen Green and Tari Eason or Desmond Bane, but I don't think the Grizzlies want more depth. I don't think the Rockets need to give up that much for Giannis right now. They don't need to make rash decisions on giving up their youth to get Giannis. MPJ is the most likely candidate. I like it for the Rockets. They get an experienced Forward that can make an immediate impact, and the Nuggets get much-needed depth from the Rockets. It might be a downgrade for the Nuggets, but they also get off of MPJ's bad contract in the future. I will say that MPJ will become a Rocket for this season.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this trade, the Rockets are still under the first apron. They need a backup PG and starting SG with only the MLE. LeVert will probably be available, but he would cost the full MLE. I think that it would be needed if they gave up Green. They need a starter and hope that Sheppard develops; if not, then give a minimum contract to Exum or Dinwiddie. I think that this would be a solid offseason to see what you've got.\n",
    "\n",
    "PG- VanVleet, Sheppard, Min\n",
    "\n",
    "SG- LeVert, Williams, Min\n",
    "\n",
    "SF- Brooks, Thompson, Min\n",
    "\n",
    "PF- MPJ, Smith Jr., Min\n",
    "\n",
    "C- Sengun, Maluach, Lockdale\n",
    "\n",
    "Ehhh, looking at this, I'm not sold. I don't think that MPJ and LeVert are worth replacing Green and Eason in the sense that LeVert and MPJ in place of Green and Eason isn't winning you the conference semifinals. I think the only players Houston would be interested in this offseason could be Giannis or KD, and contract-wise, they would need to go for the same players. In that case, Giannis moves the needle the most, but losing all 3 players isn't worth making a push in a year they don't need to. Next offseason, sure, I just don't understand doing it this offseason. Knowing this, I can play out free agency a bit. They need to fill out the backcourt, and adding Exum, Dinwiddie, or Tre Jones makes some sense. They need to add an SG as well, and Luke Kennard, Bruce Brown, or Amir Coffey could be solid additions as well if available. These are the main additions, and then sign Jeff Green to a Vet minimum. Is it title-winning moves, no. Is it to develop and see what the young guys have, and sign extensions to them to use in trade talks next offseason? Yes. They need the push right now, give it one more year, and regroup."
