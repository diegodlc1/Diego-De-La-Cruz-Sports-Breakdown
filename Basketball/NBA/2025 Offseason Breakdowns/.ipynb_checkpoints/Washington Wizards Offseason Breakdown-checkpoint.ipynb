    "One of the worst teams in the NBA has dropped to the 5th position in the NBA draft after the lottery. With a young core they don't need to make much massive changes as I don't think they expect to compete next season. With that all being said, this is how I would do the Wizards offseason."

    "The Wizards have 3 picks in this year's draft. However, I project they have 14 players under contract for the coming season. I believe that we will see the Wizards make 2 trades for this draft. They will keep their 2 first two rounders, however, they will look to move their second round pick into the future for another second round pick in the future. I also believe that the Wizards will combine 2 contracts to make a trade. Suspects are Middleton, Smart, Holmes, Bey, Kispert, and Gill. We will see a decent-sized move involving 2 of these players. I'll give it to the Nuggets for a 2032 second, 31-34 protected. \n",

He has the most value, and I'm personally not as high, but he has a good amount of value to use as a piece. I'm adding Colby Jones to them as well, since I think Kispert will attract a contender-type team, and Jones could add some youth attractiveness for that team. I think Bogdanovich from the Clippers would be an interesting target to open up cap space for the following year. If they want to add a player of the future, Rui would be a solid chase pick, however, I don't think that the Lakers want Kispert. Spurs with Barnes could be another great pick-up to open cap space. Any competing team looking for depth and youth should be looking to pick him up, and the Wizards either need to look for pieces for the future or cap space. They can get draft picks as well from whatever team is looking to make this move."
