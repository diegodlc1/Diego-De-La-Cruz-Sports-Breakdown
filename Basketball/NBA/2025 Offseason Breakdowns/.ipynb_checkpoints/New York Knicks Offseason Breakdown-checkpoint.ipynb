    "This is where the bulk of New York's free agents will come from. I think extending everyone who isn't Wright is possible. Precious Achiuwa could probably be retained for around 7.5 million for the Knicks. Payne on the vet minimum for 2.296 million cap hit, seems he likes it there, so he'll prioritize staying instead of going to a different team for the same vet minimum. Shamet will probably have to get the minimum for his experience, and get a cap hit of 2.296 as well. Seems like he's liked there, and the Knicks are a big market team. This would add 3 players for 12.096 million."

    "This leaves the Knicks at 14 players having a cap hit of 209.679 million for next season. The Knicks are in desperate need of depth pieces, but in this case, they can't aggregate players as they're above the second apron. The only free agents they can sign in this scenario are minimum contracts. That's not enough for this team, so they need to make some trades. I wouldn't touch the starting 5 at the moment. There could be some rumblings about Bridges as he's the expiring contract of the 5, but when you're this close to the title and the starting 5 isn't the main issue, then I wouldn't touch it. It's the best starting 5 in the league, and they made it this far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than that, I'm looking at Mitchell Robinson or Precious Achiuwa in a sign-and-trade. It's hard to say between the 2. Mitchell Robinson looked solid in the playoffs and will warrant a larger and better return than Achiuwa, but losing Achiuwa has less of an impact than losing Robinson. Honestly, it probably has to be Robinson. I don't think the return for Achiuwa is going to be enough to get over the Pacers. While losing Robinson is a big loss, his value will probably never be higher, and his return will be solid enough to make an impact. I don't think Achiuwa will net a return enough to get over the Pacers. Robinson can net a solid return, and that's who the Knicks need to look into trading. I think Mitchell Robinson could gain interest from many teams. Outside of teams that are young and looking to be bad, a lot of teams could use a backup big. Teams like Golden State or the Lakers need a starting big, so I will look at them first, but other than that, teams that could use him as a depth piece are the Cavs, Celtics, Bucks, Hawks, Raptors, Rockets, Nuggets, Clippers, and Spurs. Let's drop the Cavs and Celtics, as both teams' cap situations need to incorporate a 3rd team and a lot of cap moves to get a legal trade through. On top of the Knicks not wanting to help the Cavs or Celtics due to competitive reasons, we can eliminate them. With that being said, let's see what the Knicks can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden State would happen if the Warriors are looking to give up Heild. I don't think that the Warriors value Robinson that much; they're out. Lakers are out. They're not going to give up Knecht for Robinson, and no other deal can work financially. Bucks can offer Connaughton and Andre Jackson Jr. It's not a great offer for the Knicks, but it's not bad either. It's hard for the Hawks to work out a deal that benefits both teams. Raptors' money is hard to make up. Houston has Potential money, but I feel like they'll give up too much for Robinson. I don't see the Nuggets parting with what they have to get Robinson either. Clippers don't have the assets. The Spurs might do Champaign and Wesley. They desperately need a backup big, and Robinson fits the bill. The question is whether Champaign is worth more or not. Let's look at the bad teams to see if anyone would take on the expiring contract. Okogie and Jefferies from the Hornets are possible. Bey and Gill from the Wizards. Martin and Svi from Utah may be possible. I don't think the Wizards give up Bey. Other than that, this leaves the 3 other teams. I think Charlotte makes the most sense. Utah wouldn't want to give up Svi for an expiring. Spurs aren't giving that up for the Robinson, and the Milwaukee deal isn't good for the Knicks. Okogie and Jeffries are a decent return for the Knicks. This cuts 2.4 million from the cap and gives the Knicks 15 players at 207.279 million. This puts them barely below the second apron and allows them to aggregate for a trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows one more deal to be made. Combine Kolek and Dadiet to make a bad team for more depth. Drew Eubanks, Dwight Powell, Kevin Love, and Svi are all possible options. Drew Eubanks is a great option, and the Clippers need to look at getting younger. This would be a solid return for both teams. This subtracts .289 million from the Knicks' cap sheet. This leaves 14 players for 206.990 million. Add a UDFA for 1.273 million, putting them at 15 players for 208.263, slightly over the cap.\n",
