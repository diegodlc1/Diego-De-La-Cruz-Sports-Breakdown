    "The Atlanta Hawks are right there with the Kings. A team looking to compete but haven't gotten over the hump since the 2021 season. Truthfully, the Hawks have some pieces. While I don't believe that the Hawks can contend for a title, the playoffs shouldn't be out of the scope. I don't think that they need to tank; they have pieces now, but they're in the basketball purgatory spot at the moment. We can cough it up to injuries this year, but I don't think that with a healthy squad, they were on the same level as the playoff teams in the East outside of the Heat. With that being said, this is how I would go about the offseason."

    "The Hawks have 2 first-rounders in the draft this year. They own the Kings' 13th pick and the Lakers' 22nd pick. They will be making both selections in this year's draft unless a team were to want to trade for the 22nd pick. Either way, I don't do draft day trades, so they make both selections in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Hawks need 2 things. Front-court depth and PG depth. I think they have solid wing players, but the frontcourt is severely lacking in players. Richardson is a solid prospect in his PG abilities. Able to create and score, they can develop him to work under Trae Young. Fleming is another interesting prospect in his ability to do everything well. He's a catch and shoot big who provides great spacing for whatever team gets him. This would be a solid draft for the Hawks and fits their system well. Add 2 players for 8.272 million."

You can make an argument for Matthews or LeVert, but the SG position will be held by Mann and Daniels for years to come. No point in bringing them back. Nance Jr. doesn't fit the squad much and would just take up a roster spot. Capela is an interesting player at the moment. I think a team will give him a chance, and the Hawks need Center depth, however, they can get him using the MLE they would receive. At this moment, no one gets extended, but I will come back to this during free agency."

    "The Hawks are under the Cap and can make a bigger splash. Looking at options, Bobby Portis, Jonathan Kuminga, and Naz Reid should be the goal. All 3 teams have full bird rights for each player and can thus offer as much as the Hawks could in exchange for that player. I still don't think that this means much to the Hawks. Would they have to overpay, give a player an option year, or give extra years to the player? Yes, but it would be worth it. Looking at the potential players, I think all are attainable. The Warriors are sick of Kuminga and wouldn't match much of what would be offered to him. Reid and Portis are loved by both teams, but if Giannis leaves Milwaukee and/or the T-Wolves don't win this year, and what they're saying about keeping the tax bill low is true, then both options can happen. Ranking fit, I think it would be Reid, Portis, then Kuminga. The Hawks can spend upwards of 18.033 million using the cap space and MLE, more than what most teams can use the MLE on and the options these players have. It's honestly hard to predict. I can see all being options or none. Kuminga is the player with the highest chance, as the Warriors are done with him, and I don't think he'll pull more than 18 million in free agency. I don't think Portis is worth an overpay for the Hawks based on timelines, and thus basically being matched by Milwaukee, which they will do if Giannis is still a Buck, but if Giannis leaves, the Hawks will most likely get him with a slight overpay. Reid is interesting in that the Hawks could be selling him short at 18.033 million a year, but the Wolves or Nets can offer him more money than what the Hawks can pay, but will they? I'll go with Kuminga right now, since that's a certainty that the Hawks can get using 15-16 million and still have space to pay above the minimum contract and grab another player. This can be spent on someone like Steven Adams. Bring him to Atlanta, and the Hawks should be ready for the season. I would look to trade Niang for a backup Center at the deadline. Mitchell Robinson is a name to think about there."
