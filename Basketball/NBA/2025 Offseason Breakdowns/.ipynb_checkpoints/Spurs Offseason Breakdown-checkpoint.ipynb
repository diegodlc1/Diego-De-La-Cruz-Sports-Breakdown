While I believe Spurs fans didn't think they were going to make a deep playoff run, they ended up losing Wemby and finishing outside of the play-in.

    "With 4 players having team options, the Spurs get to make a decision on the 4 players. Wemby is picked up without a doubt. Even with the injury concern his deal needs to be picked up. The rest is interesting. I think that the Spurs will make a big move, I'll mention it later on, so with that move on the horizon, I think that Branham's and Sochan options should be picked up. You need to fill out the roster, and having control over these 2 players is important. Do I think Sochan and Branham are worth those contracts? Not really. Having control is more important for the Spurs, and they are expiring after this year, so just pick it up and roll with it. With the addition of Harper, you can drop Wesley, he isn't worth that money."

CP3 is in a convoluted backcourt and would be looking for more money than what he would be worth. McLaughlin isn't good. Mamu and Biyombo have shown promise in fitting with the team. Biyombo is on a Vet minimum, and Mamu can pull around 6.5 million for this next season. I think that they would both be worth some of the NTMLE. this would put them 8.796 million extra onto the cap.

This would hard cap the Spurs above the first apron by taking in around 10 million more dollars than what they could, however, it's the move the Spurs should make, especially if Harper joins the Spurs. Vassell wouldn't be needed, KD is an upgrade to Johnson, and you make a move while Wemby is cheap. This is a necessary move to push the Spurs into playoff contention. This would leave one spot open for the Spurs to use on an undrafted free agent. I would say you can have 15 players at 188.479 million dollars and hard-capping the Spurs at the Second apron.\n",
