They don't have much depth pieces to cover up these shortfalls. The Suns don't have much going for them, let's play out their offseason to make that happen."

    "The Suns have 2 picks in this upcoming draft. They have the Cavs pick at 29, and they have Denver's second-round pick. These are both deep in their respective rounds, but both players need to be signed to the Cavs as they're already above the second apron with only 10 players. They need to add youth and depth, and both of these players would provide that. With that being said, here is what I believe will be the first round selection and the cap implications.\n",

    "Joan will drop to the end of the first round. While he has a lot of upside, I don't think many teams will bite at him. He'll fall to the end of the first round, and the Suns would pick him up in need of a Center and youth. He won't provide much depth, though. However, they need to sign their second-round pick due to salary cap reasons and bringing in youth. 2 players for 4.037 million."

    "The Suns have 5 expiring contracts. Damion Lee, Mason Plumlee, Monte Morris, Tyus Jones, and Bol Bol. Truthfully, there are only 2 players in this grouping that deserve an extension: Tyus Jones and Bol Bol. However, Jones will pull a bigger contract from another team than what the Suns can offer. The Suns only have his non-Bird rights and can sign him to only 2.505 million. He'll get at least some of the NTMLE somewhere else and leave the Suns (unless the Suns make a major move to free up cap space to make the move, we can play that out later). Bol Bol is easier to get since they have his early-bird rights. They can give him a contract up to 9.191 million dollars. No team will give him anywhere above that number, so the Suns should be able to retain him for above the minimum. I think going slightly above the minimum would be worth it at around 2.5 million. Everyone else isn't really worth it, except to fill out the roster if needed. Plumlee and Morris can come back for the minimum contract again at 2.296 million each. Lee is done for, not point in bringing him back, so, 3 players added for 7.092 million."

    "So let's talk about trading. The Suns need to make a move at this point. They're going nowhere and have no control over their own picks between now and 2031. In this case, they need to stay competing since they can't tank, but they need to make changes to try, since what they have going for them has them out of the playoffs. With that being said, there is only one valuable resource that they need to give up: Kevin Durant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the thing: the Suns can decide on 3 routes. They can decide to take back 39,762,598 maximum after the draft and be able to bring back Tyus Jones on the TMLE. They could take back 27,883,598 maximum after the draft to open the NTMLE for other free agents. They can take more than the 39 million and still be over the Second Apron and still have the restrictions. The question ends up being whether the Suns want to compete and take this as a retool, or take on draft picks to rebuild. Truthfully, Beal is under contract for 2 more seasons, Booker is under contract for 3 more seasons, and in what should be his prime right now. With this going for them, they should look at retooling. They don't need to take back the full salary, but they should aim to bring back over the 27 million number I set. Truthfully, Durant would only draw massive interest for a team close to the title. He's not going to get interest from a young team or a team that's more than one KD away from a title. Grizzlies, Bucks, Magic, Hawks, Bulls, and Heat are all more than one KD away from winning. They don't need to make a push for KD when there's more holes that need to be filled. I'll eliminate the Cavs and Celtics since they're going to be over the second apron as well, unless they make moves before making the trade to get below the second apron. I'll also eliminate the Knicks and Nuggets because if I'm running the Suns, I'm looking for 2 playable players and not one great player plus filler. This leaves the Pacers, Pistons, Sixers, Thunder, Rockets, Lakers, Clippers, T-Wolves, Warriors, and Spurs. The timeline doesn't fit for the Pistons or Rockets, so I'll eliminate them. Warriors are out due to the culture fit, and they don't need Forward help at the moment. This leaves the Pacers, Sixers, Thunder, Lakers, Clippers, T-Wolves, and Spurs. The Pacers are out. Haliburton and Siakam won't be moved for him, and thus, leaving Turner to be the only one to be traded. He needs to be resigned and can't be traded in the offseason. Sixers are out. Maxey would need to be moved since the Suns have no interest in Embiid or PG at the moment, and he won't be traded. Truthfully, it'll be tough for a lot of these teams due to the salary cap. The Thunder, Clippers, and Spurs are the most likely fit. T-Wolves have a solid chance too. The Pacers, Sixers, and Lakers don't have the players and/or the contracts/cap space to work with. Looking deeply into the final 4 teams, I think that the T-Wolves and Thunder have the best bet. Clippers would have to give up Zubac, and to me, that's not worth it for the Clippers. The Spurs have nothing of interest to the Suns unless they want to give up Fox, and since they just traded for him, I don't think the Spurs are looking to shop him for an aging KD. Looking closer, the Thunder are pretty much the only team that can land him. The T-Wolves can't make up salary well unless they give up a lot of depth, and truthfully, it would be too much for the T-Wolves to give up. The Thunder would have the only deal of interest. Hartenstein, Kenrich Williams, Isaiah Joe, and picks would be enough to make the trade happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Plumlee doesn't need to come back, and Tyus Jones doesn't come back since they'll still be above the second apron and not have space. I would say you could bring back Monte Morris, but I have another idea: move Grayson Allen for a PG. You have the second-rounder be a PG and use some of the picks received from both the Jazz and the KD trade, and trade Allen + Picks for Cole Anthony. The Magic would need to get under the first apron before this trade could go through, but it would make the most sense for both teams. The Magic need an SG and the Suns need a PG. This would be the depth chart.\n",
