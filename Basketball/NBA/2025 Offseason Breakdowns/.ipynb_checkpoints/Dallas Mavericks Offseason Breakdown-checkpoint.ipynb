    "The Mavericks made a massive trade at the deadline, sending Luke Doncic to the Lakers in exchange for AD. With this trade, it seems the Mavs will look to win now with this roster. With Kyrie expected to be out for most of the season, the Mavs need to look at ways to make a championship push with their expensive, aging roster. This is how I would do the offseason."

    "If the defense wins championships, philosophy still stands, and Sorber would be the selection here. He's a great 2-way player who can develop behind AD. I see him being a PF more so than a Center, so I believe that Sorber would be a great selection. He's not ready to compete just yet, but being able to develop in that frontcourt, he could turn into a great player. It's not a win now move but it is a move"

    "The Mavs have Exum and Dinwiddie on expiring contracts. While both had solid years, I think only one of them should be brought back to fill the need. They're not starting guards at this point in their careers. If I'm entering the season with one of them as the starting guard, I'm concerned. Looking at free agency, they could make a push for Westbrook if he doesn't pick up his option. Other than that, I can see D'Lo being an option to use the full MLE or even KPJ. Even then, D'Lo is the closest thing a competing team with the full MLE can get. This will be free agency, though. Between Dinwiddie and Exum, I'm going for Dinwiddie. He's all around better and cheaper. Exum only has the age going for him. Give him a 2.610 million contract or the vet min to have Dinwiddie make the most money."

    "I see 2 options at this point: use the MLE to bring in DLo or make a trade. If they sign Dinwiddie with the Non-Bird, then they would be over the first apron and thus restricting them. That's why I think a vet minimum with a promise for a bigger role compared to the rest of the league could help Dinwiddie take the vet minimum and stay with the Mavs after a trade or signing DLO. Truthfully, we can look at trade options and determine what would be the most likely move. \n",

    "Honestly, I don't see much of anything. The only option would be to send Gafford and Williams to Golden State or the Lakers, and either receive Reaves or Moody, and send Klay Thompson for a PG, or send Reaves and Moody to get a PG in return. However, any of these moves doesn't open the idea of a starting PG unless you pull out Stephon Castle from the Spurs, which rotating one of them to the Spurs may make some sense, especially Reaves, but I don't see that happening. At best, I think Mavs get Castle, Lakers get Gafford and Williams plus a pick, and Spurs get Reaves plus a pick. I don't know if the Lakers would do this, though, and who knows about the Spurs doing this either. Truthfully, the best bet is to get DLo on the MLE and role with Dinwiddie as the backup. I don't think the Spurs will give up Castle, so just pursue DLO and hope for the best."
