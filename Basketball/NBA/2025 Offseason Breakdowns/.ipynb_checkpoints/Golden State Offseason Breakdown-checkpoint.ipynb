    "The Warriors have 6 extensions coming in for this next season. Spencer and Key are gone; no need to talk to them. I really like Knox at a minimum. He'll only warrant that in the open market, so the Warriors should be able to get him. Now we're down to Gary Payton, Looney, and Kuminga. They have all of their Bird Rights to be used. Gary Payton will sign on a veteran minimum. He's not going to warrant money in the open market, and I think he would want to play out the rest of his career with the Warriors. 2-year vet minimum with a player option in the second year. Warriors should give Looney a 2-year contract for 6 million a year to retain him. Looney is worth the money for the Warriors and should be under a 2-year contract, and end with the rest. Now this leaves Kuminga. He isn't going to be on the Warriors, but he is a restricted free agent, so the Warriors have the ability to pull a sign and trade which they will. With that being said I'll continue this below."

    "Right now, the Warriors are at 13 players worth 183.156 million. This is without the Kuminga extension. Kuminga will get a 22 million extension for around 3 years, and will be used to trade out for either a Center or both that and a backup PG. With this signing, it puts them above the first apron and thus has some restrictions. They have 8 options contract-wise. Nikola Vucevic, Jarrett Allen, Jakob Poeltl, Jusuf Nurkic, Ivica Zubac, Zach Collins, Jonathan Isaac, Isaiah Stewart, Onyeka Okongwu. Let's eliminate some as being untradeable or not worth it. Poeltl isn't leaving in the offseason, Zubac isn't either. Nurkic and Collins aren't worth their contracts, nor are they worth Kuminga. This leaves Allen, Isaac, Stewart, and Okongwu. I think the Cavs would be very interested in Kuminga, but with the Cavs being a second-round team, it'll be hard. I don't think the Magic would be interested in Kuminga. Atlanta doesn't have much Center depth to do this. This leaves Detroit and Stewart. I think Detroit would be interested in Kuminga as a future piece, and while Stewart is a solid player for them, they have Duren, who is the Center of their future. The biggest question mark from this is a short frontcourt that the Warriors would be rolling with here. Vucevic is also a solid option, but the Bulls gave Patrick Williams a large extension, so who knows what happens. We can see the Kings as well, Valanciunas and Devin Carter would be the package, and would be solid for the Warriors. I think either the Kings or the Bulls due to Stewart's and Draymond's size. I'll give them Vuc since Kuminga is better than Williams, while the Kings have Murray at his age and talent. I would rather have that.\n",

    "After this, the Warriors can either make a trade or use the TPMLE. I think using some of the TPMLE on Exum or such would be the best. It'll be hard to upgrade certain positions at this point unless they trade some youth, which I don't think will be worth it at this point. Aaron Holiday could also be an option, which is better. Those are the 2 for that position.\n",
