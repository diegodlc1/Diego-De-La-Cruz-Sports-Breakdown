    "The Kings need to make a trade. Malik Monk will probably be moved to make this happen. The Kings need a starting PG and some depth at SF. While they can attempt to get DLO with the full MLE, I think that looking to trade for a better PG would be the best option. I think the Kings want someone on a 2-year deal to line up with the rest of the team, or a young, serviceable PG to extend past this period. I see 5 teams and 6 possible targets. Chicago, Orlando, Detroit, San Antonio, New Orleans. White/Dosunmu, Black, Ivey, Castle, and Alverado are the top teams. Truthfully, I don't think the Bulls would give up White for Monk, and San Antonio won't give up Castle for Monk either unless they want to compete. Either way, Castle is probably off the list. This leaves Dosunmu, Black, Ivey, and Alverado. Orlando may do it, but they would have to give up Carter Jr. or Goga if they get under the first apron. New Orleans would do Alverado and Herb Jones. Detroit offers Fontecchio and Ivey for Monk. Chicago is Ayo and Matas. Chicago doesn't do that since they really don't need a SG like Monk that bad. I don't think Sacramento would be interested in Goga, but would be in WCJ, although Orlando isn't interested in that. They won't do that. This leaves New Orleans and Detroit. If I'm the Kings, I'll pick Detroit. They need a PG more than an SF, and Ivey is better and younger than Alverado. I think that adding a pick from Detroit would be the best to match up in value. They could add Ron Holland and drop the pick, though. It depends on what Detroit thinks would be best. I'll go with Fontecchio for Detroit and a first-round pick. \n",
    "\n",
    "For free agency, the Kings could use a backup or third-string PG/SF or a third-string Center. Aiming for Brogdon, Schroder, CP3, or Exum would all be solid options. Cam Payne, Elfrid Payton, and Fultz would all be solid to bring in as well. Jae'Sean Tate is the only SF option to truly bring back. Gibson, Plumlee, or Len are the options at Center. Truthfully, the Kings should aim high for a PG and then bring back McDermott, Plumlee, and a second-rounder to be a SG. Schroder or CP3 is the best for that, but Brogdon and Exum aren't terrible either. This should set the Kings at around 184 million in a cap hit, well below the first apron and looking to compete.\n",
