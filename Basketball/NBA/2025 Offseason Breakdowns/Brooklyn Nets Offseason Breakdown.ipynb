    "The Brooklyn Nets have embraced the tank. They ended up with the 4th overall pick, 4 picks in the first round, and a second-round pick, all in this year's draft. With only 4 players under contract, 5 options, 4 picks in this year's draft, and around 100 million under the cap, I want to play out the Nets offseason."

The question is if they're going to combo the 19th with the 27th to move up, or will they kick the 2nd round pick a year later. I believe they would kick the 2nd round pick to a future season. I'm giving it to Milwaukee for the 2031 second round pick.\n",
