    "The Lakers are coming into this season with higher aspirations than they had coming into last season. The Lakers have been given Luka Doncic in a trade, however, they fell flat in the playoffs, losing in the first round. With LeBron's career coming to a close, the Lakers only have a couple of years to capitalize on him until they would have to go in a retool, with that being said let's play out this offseason."

LeBron is winding down his career, and you can argue that he can decline the option and sign an extension for more years for less per year. However, I don't think that it'll happen, as who knows if he wants to continue to play after next season. He picks up his option, and DFS isn't making that money in the free agent market so he will pick up his option."

    "The Lakers have 13 players making 194.201 million, pushing the first apron heavily. They would have the full MLE to use or extra cap space to make a trade. The question ends up with what they would want to use first. The options are Capela, Lopez, and Adams. They bring what the Lakers are looking for in defensive production, and one of these players will be picked up by the Lakers. I mean, I want to look at potential trade options at the Center position first before I commit to one of these players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at potential trade targets, I'll add together Gabe Vincent and DFS to look at potential players. These two are expiring, and a tanking team would gladly take on these players for picks. This gives the Lakers options of Claxton, Vucevic, and John Collins. I don't think the Lakers are getting any of these players. Vuc and Collins aren't what the Lakers want in a big. They need to look for a defensively-minded big with athleticism being a plus if possible. Vuc and Collins are offensive-minded big men and not worth it. Claxton is who the Lakers would love to have, but I don't think that the Nets want to give him up unless they get a hefty overpay. 2031 plus all other picks as swaps would be the payload. It would also have to involve Knecht, but I'm not sure if it's worth all of that for the Lakers. Let's continue to look around. With Knecht and DFS, you can maybe get Mitchell Robinson from the Knicks or Daniel Gafford from the Mavs. Even then, the Knicks don't have cap flexibility to bring in them two. The Mavs are a maybe, actually. Add a defensive-minded PF for the season and another young shooter on the bench to either develop or set up a future trade. Even then, I think the Mavs are already too deep that DFS and Knecht aren't worth it for them in those positions. Hachimura and Vincent could get Porzingis. While Porzingis doesn't fit the mold of what the Lakers want, his production is worth letting that go. The Celtics need to cut salary, and next season is a wash with Tatum going down with a possible Achilles injury, essentially putting him out for the year. Hachimura adds some youth and front-court help next season, and Vincent is an expiring contract next year. The only roadblock is that the Celtics and Lakers rarely trade with each other; the last time was 2006, and who knows if either team would help out the other? Other than that, they can get the above trades too with this combo, but I would rather keep Hachimura than DFS. Other than that, Hachimura and Knecht might pull a solid deal. With these two, Isaiah Stewart is an option. Jaren Jackson Jr. is a pipe dream, but a somewhat viable option. Jarrett Allen is also a more viable option for Hachimura and  Knecht. The issue with all of these trades is that JJJ is most likely not going to happen. Allen could, and I would seriously consider it if I were the Cavs, the issue is that the Cap situation for the Cavs makes it a hard deal to happen. The Stewart deal, I would also seriously consider if I'm the Pistons, but he's not joining a team with LeBron on it, and I don't think the Pistons want Hachimura or Knecht enough to look past that for him. Truthfully, Porzingis is the best, most logical answer. Boston adds youth and control in Hachimura. They cut the tax bill a little bit, and Vincent's contract comes off next season; they're not competing next season anyway, and need to cut the tax bill. Now, granted, the Celtics' goal might be to combine Porzingis and Holiday for a player to still compete and get under the second apron. Either way, this is the deal that makes the most sense for either player. We'll give them Porzingis for the time being for Vincent, Hachimura, and picks, adding a million in cap space. Now the Lakers are still under the first apron and have the full MLE to work with. I think they can get Chris Paul. The Lakers only need a backup, and CP3 is someone who would want to play on the Lakers. I think 8-9 million is enough to get him. The Lakers can then go after Looney or Horford with the 5-6 million they have left in the MLE. Then sign a minimum guy or the second-rounder. By technicality, they would have to give a deal less than the NTMLE for Looney first, then go after the backup PG. This gives the Lakers 15 players for around 211.306 million, well above the second apron. \n",
