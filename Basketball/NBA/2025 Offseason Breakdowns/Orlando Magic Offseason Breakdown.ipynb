    "The Magic are currently at 184.804 million spent on the roster for 14 players, they have the full MLE to work with. First things first, a trade needs to be done. The Magic needs a shooter badly. KCP has been a failed signing, and the Magic need to capitalize on Banchero's cheap contract. While a free agent could work as the SG market this year will be solid, however, the Magic have enough depth to make a trade happen if they want to. I think combining their PG with Jett Howard could get a solid SG from a trade. Breaking this down, here are realistic options.\n",

    "Truthfully, Suggs is probably out of this deal. I don't think that the Hornets would want this deal unless they get all of the Magic's picks. Other than that I'll try to move Anthony instead of Black, as Anthony is slightly older and would be worth the move. With that being said, let's look at those deals. We can drop Mann. Anthony is worth more than Mann, and the Magic can get something more than him. The Clippers don't need Anthony. I don't think the Jazz care about Anthony either. This leaves the Heat, Knicks, Suns, Wizards, T-Wolves, and Warriors. We can drop the Knicks and Wizards due to fit and how the depth chart works. This leaves the other 4 teams. I think that all 4 teams would gladly take them on, but we need to look for teams that would really want Anthony enough to start him. This drops the Warriors since I don't think he'll start on the Warriors. The Heat, Suns, and T-Wolves are the remaining teams. I think we can drop the Heat, as they may like Mitchell enough to start him compared to Anthony. This leaves the T-Wolves and Suns. Looking at either Allen or DiVencenzo. Truthfully, both teams are too close to the apron that Howard would need to be dropped to make either deal work. I think Allen is the best option for the Magic to take on based on everything. This would add 3.7 to the cap and stay at 14 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Magic now have the full MLE to work with and will use it to get a minimum-level PG or SG. They can look around to grab that min-14.7 million player to add to the roster. Adding another SG to try and get another shooter on the roster. Try to get Bruce Brown at best, but they probably won't get him. Other than that, they can retain Gary Harris for cheaper or pick up his option since their below the first apron either way. Truthfully, Gary Harris for cheap may be the way to go."
