    "The Utah Jazz has 4 picks in this year's draft, they have their own pick at 2, the T-Wolves' pick at 21, and 2 second-round picks from the Mavs and Clippers. At the moment, I predict the Jazz will have 14 players in their lineup coming into next season. In that case, I believe the Jazz will package their 2 seconds from this year for an early second next year. It's tough to call on their 2 first two. We might see a 2-for-1 being made, or the second first from this year may be traded to next season. Truthfully, I see a trade back for the year. They will trade the Jazz will only use their second overall pick this year, and run it back with most of what they have this year. The roster looks full this year and depleted next. The Jazz don't have many picks next year to fill out the roster, and they will have a somewhat expensive team next season. Now let's pick 2 teams to receive these picks. I'm going with the Knicks to grab the 2nd-round pick this year for Washington's second-round pick for next season. This helps the Knicks fill contracts and youth onto their team for this year to see what they can do. The first overall pick for next season. The 21st overall pick will go to the Kings for a first-round pick in next year's draft (lottery protected) and a second-round pick in next year's or in 2027's draft. This will give the Kings a first and the Jazz a potentially better first for next season if the Kings don't get better. This leaves just one pick in this year's draft.\n",

    "1. VJ Edgecombe, 12.370 million year 1\n",

    "The Jazz are in an interesting scenario with this pick. I believe there are 2 tiers at the top. Flagg is in his own tier, and Harper, Edgecombe, and Bailey are in the next. You can't go wrong with the rest, and in that case, I will go with the fit between the 3. That is Edgecombe in this scenario. Able to play SG/SF vs. Harper being a PG/SG, the Jazz can have more flexibility in the future on where they can place him and what they can do. They can keep Sexton and move Edgecombe to the 3, move on from Sexton and Clarkson next year, and move Edgecombe to the 2, and see if Sensabaugh develops to a high level at the 3. Truthfully, this pick gives more flexibility and less convolution for the Jazz to build off of."

Collins is weird in that I can see rejecting for a larger contract, but I also can see him getting less than his option. His range i between 22-32 million a year. His safest bet is to pick up the option and get better for another year. I think he should just pick it up since he only played 47 games a year, and try to work on his game next year to get an extension."

Sexton/Clarkson and Markkanen/Collins play the SG and PF positions, and you look to trade any of them, but for whom right now? They don't need to fill in SG or PF because if they trade one of them, the other will become the starter. You can look to upgrade those positions, but I'm just not sure. I think that at the deadline, someone is going to be moved. To start the season, I don't see any movement unless you want to look to get an upgrade for a non-competitive team, which doesn't make sense. I see a trade at the deadline for a team in need of an SG or PF, and competing for some young talent or a salary dump and picks. Right now, I see nothing, though. Only thing is depth for more depth but I like the Jazz dpeth so I wouldn't touch any of that."
