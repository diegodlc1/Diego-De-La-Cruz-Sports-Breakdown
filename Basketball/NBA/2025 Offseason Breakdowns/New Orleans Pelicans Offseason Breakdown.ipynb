Another issue is wing spacing, which I think Knueppel is able to provide the spacing that complements Zion. He has a great shot, and I believe that he fits in with the Pelicans team well. He can fill SF and SG, depending on where the Pelicans want to put him, to base their future decisions with McCollum."

You can argue that they could pick up both options, however, I feel like the backcourt is too convoluted compared to other positions. He'll add 2.3 million dollars for the coming season."

I think grabbing a Taj Gibson or Mason Plumlee is the best bet, giving them a 2.296 million hit for the coming season.\n",

I don't think that the Pelicans really know what they have coming into this season and are kind of stuck cap-wise, to make any move to try and influence these moves. Truthfully, the Pelicans need to see what they have this season. They need to see health, they need to see chemistry, and if they're competing, they can make moves at the deadline. Nothing needs to be done right now though."
