    "The Charlotte Hornets are still in purgatory. They've been picking in the lottery and haven't been able to escape the lottery. They haven't made the playoffs since 2016. They haven't made the play-in since 2022. They need to make changes. After an injury-filled season and dropping to the 6th pick (in my lottery), changes need to be made, but what? I'll try to play out this offseason."

    "The Hornets have 3 picks in this year's draft. They own their own pick in the first, and 2 seconds. Issue is that I'm projecting that the Hornets will come into the season with 13 players on their roster. For this reason, I'm going to say that they will trade a worse second to the Clippers for a 2032 second-round pick, most likely more types of picks, but I like to keep it simple. Anyways, with these moves, these are the numbers attributed to those picks.\n",

    "Options are pretty easy to predict. I don't see a world in which the Hornets won't pick up any of the 3 players' options. They were all starters at some point during the season. There's concern about injury for both Miller and Williams, however, I don't think it's a concern to not pick up their contracts, which are relatively cheap compared to their worth. Smith Jr. is still young and on a cheap deal. If you think Tre Johnson takes his spot, you can pick him up and trade him later. All 3 contracts need to be picked up though."

    "I get that both Gibson and Curry are culture guys on some cheaper deals. The issue is that the Hornets could use those roster spots elsewhere this year. I wouldn't look to retain either of them and move them to coaching roles of some sort. They're getting pushed out by youth, which is ok. Tre Mann needs to get a contract, though. He has performed well behind LaMelo, and with the opening of minutes after the moves were made during the season by the Hornets, they need a backup. I'm thinking a 2-year deal worth around 5 million per year. Locks him down to see what he has and hasn't played substantial minutes to deserve a larger one. It's a 2-year prove-it deal."

    "With all of these deals, the Hornets are at 15 players for a salary of 165.831 million. We could make the second-round pick a 2-way contract and make a push to sign an SF. I just don't know who. Maybe Jae'Sean Tate, McDermott, Crowder. It makes the most sense to use the second-rounder to grab a backup SF. Use that spot for that.\n",

    "I think a trade would be the most likely. I'm thinking Josh Green and DaQuan Jefferies for Keldon Johnson and open the roster spot to grab a min guy at PG. The Spurs need to fill out the SG position with a backup, and Josh Green is a youngish backup to fulfill that. Keldon Johnson gives the Hornets much-needed depth at the SF position. Depending on the contract the Kuminga was to sign with the Warriors, I can see a sign and trade deal involving him being moved to the Hornets; however, I don't think he starts, and he would be the player who wants to start. They need to shore up SF depth. The issue is that the contracts involved may not look to be a backup. It's tough to say, and the decision to shore up that position in free agency makes some sense, I just don't know who fits the bill. They're looking for backups, but for that money, they're not really getting backups that fit the money. It doesn't make much sense."
