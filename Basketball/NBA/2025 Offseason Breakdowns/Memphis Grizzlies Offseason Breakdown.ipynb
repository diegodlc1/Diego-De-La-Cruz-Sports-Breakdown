Since peaking at the 2 seed for both the 21-22 and 22-23 seasons, the Grizzlies both missed the playoffs and only gotten the 8 seed this previous season. The Grizzlies need to make some big moves to compete with the rest of the West. They have the foundation, but they need the extra step to make that point."

    "The Grizzlies have 4 extensions that would need to be talked about, but we can brush on a few of them. Stevens, Kennard, and Bagley can all be dropped. Kennard put up solid stats, but is clogging play time for the younger players, he'll find a stint somewhere else. Bagley has solid games here and there, but is too inconsistent to include. He would also clog playing time for the youth. Stevens isn't worth it either. This leaves Aldama, who deserves a nice extension. I can see an 18-19 million dollar a year deal for him. I'll give him the 19 since I think that's more of his value, so we can go from there. This would add one player for 19 million. This puts the Grizzlies over the salary cap and thus only gives them the MLE to work with."

    "The Grizzlies only have the MLE to work with. The Grizzlies need to make a move this offseason. You have a solid core, but after this season, I have no hope for this core to win a championship. They can wait another year to develop the youth and see if a core of Ja, Bane, JJJ, Aldama, and great depth is enough to get a championship. Until a recent Championship is won by not having a top 10 player in the league, then I'll hold the belief that a top 10 player is needed. The 2014 Spurs were the last team to not have a top 10 player in the league, 11 years ago, with different cap rules and a whole different league in general. If the Pacers, Warriors, or Cavs win, then I will say the Grizzlies can keep the core for another year; if not, then a major move would need to be made. With that being said, let's start with trade ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main piece for a major trade will be Desmond Bane. He's put up good numbers, and his contract isn't bad for his age. He would need to be paired up with one of Clarke, GG, Edey, or Huff to be moved. Honestly, GG and Huff would need to be moved together to make a more impactful salary-wise trade, as both by themselves with Bane wouldn't net anything crazy. Honestly, including both of them would only net Kawhi Leonard more than just using one of them. Including one allows trading for LaVine, Markkanen, Murray, Mitchell, Mobley, Luka, and Trae vs. just trading Bane. Edey opens up more options, and Clarke allows every NBA player to be able to be traded for salary-wise. Knowing this, let's look at a bubbling-to-contending team in need of an SG and front-court depth that has a backlog at SF. Honestly, the Grizzlies don't have many options. Looking at potential landing spots, we can talk about some. Jaylen Brown is the juiciest name of the bunch. The Celtics want to get a lower cap sheet and would be looking to trade pieces in the offseason. However, Brown is the second least likely player to be moved, and they don't need an SG and have bad depth at SF. Paul George and Markkanen are potential names as well, and I fully believe both teams would do that deal with Memphis, but if I'm Memphis, I would rather keep Bane than take on either of these 2's terrible contract. If Markkanen can put up a solid year next year, then maybe, but this offseason it's a no for me. Paul George is washed. Anunoby is a no-go since the Knicks don't need Bane when Hart is servicable alongside the rest of the team. Brandon Ingram would be a maybe if he didn't get traded for at the deadline this previous season. I think Toronto wants to see what they have in him and won't make a trade involving them. This leaves Jalen Johnson and the Atlanta Hawks. It makes some sense. The Hawks have a young Risacher who is similar to Johnson. The Grizzlies would like to have him. I don't think the Hawks would care to do this right now. At some point, Risacher and Johnson will be traded, or one of them needs to develop as more of a PF playstyle, but the time isn't now. They also don't need an SG with Daniels being a solid player for the Hawks. With this, I don't think the Grizzlies will do a major trade. I don't see the need to move JJJ or Morant at this point either. \n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't mean that a nice trade can't happen, though. Clarke will need to be included for his salary. Then one of Edey, Huff, Wells, or Williams Jr. needs to be included. They need a starter, so I will include Edey first, for his contract and value. I only see 2 options for this: DeAndre Hunter and either Hachimura or Reaves. The Grizzlies won't move for Hachimura. They won't make a trade with the Lakers unless they get Reaves. I don't know if they would do it, though. The Cavs would. They need front-court depth badly and have Strus, who's able to play the 3 sufficiently. This would also lower their cap sheet. Honestly, the Lakers deal won't go through. Grizzlies would want Reaves, and the Lakers won't trade Reaves for Edey at the moment. Depending on what happens with the Cavs, this playoff run will determine what they should do, too. If they lose due to a lack of front-court depth, then the Cavs do this move; if not, they won't. They just traded for Hunter and will hold on if need be. Looking at the next highest contract, we have Vince Williams. Honestly, the Grizzlies won't garner much interest from this. Outside of maybe KJ Martin, there isn't much of a landing spot for this due to. Even then, Williams is as old as Martin, and Martin is better. The Jazz have no use for Clarke at this point either, especially for 2 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves Wells. His contract and his play could garner a lot of interest. At the same time, I don't think that the Grizzlies let him go for cheap. They can grab any SF from 7.2275 million to 21.955 million. The issue is that I wouldn't do most of them, and the select few that would be done, I'm not sure if the other team would do it. I would say the best deal would be getting Risacher or something along those lines, but the Hawks won't do that yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, trade-wise, the best deal the Grizzlies would want is to bring in Reaves, the most realistic would be getting Hunter. Is Edey worth Hunter? Since his time with Cleveland, no, with his time in Atlanta, yes. I'll give them Hunter, but if the Lakers like Edey a lot, then the Grizzlies have a realistic shot at Reaves. Other than that, they have the MLE. I think spending it all on Kelly Oubre is the best option. They need SF depth badly. While Ja is injury-prone and having better depth at PG is great, they can get a min player in Payton or something. Tate, Batum, or Prince could fit too, but they need SF and depth badly there. Spending the MLE on Oubre is a great move for them. They can fill out the rest of the roster with min players if need be."
