It is early enough to warrant a pick and a full contract, but the issue comes from whether a team like the Wolves would look to give the full contract. With that being said, let's do the draft.\n",

He's an all-around great player with a high floor and low ceiling. For a team looking to compete, he's a great fit at the moment. This adds one player for 4.201 million."

Outside of the Pistons or Nets, no one else can pay either one of them the money that they want. The Nets might be interested in Reid, but won't be in Randle. The Pistons would be the only team that could be interested in Randle. With that being said, if I were either player's agent, I'd tell Randle to opt in and Reid to opt out.

I won't talk about Ingles at the moment since I think he can come back on a vet minimum if needed, but honestly, the second-rounder is more valuable than him, so he's dropped for now. This leaves both Alexander-Walker and Reid. One will stay, and the other will be traded in a sign-and-trade. The Wolves are at 13 players spending 181.511 million a year. Keeping both players would put the Wolves in the second apron. Keeping Reid would put them in the first apron; keeping NAW would put them just below the first apron. Truthfully, they need to keep Reid. He's worth the money and younger than NAW. Giving him a 20-million-dollar contract would be enough. for that. NAW would pull the full MLE from a team in free agency, so signing him to a 14.5 million contract to use in a sign and trade."

    "Let's start with NAW first. Toppin, Grant Williams, Olynyk, Holmes, and Clark are all possible options. I think all 5 players are possible for the Wolves. I would drop Holmes as I'm not sure the Wizards would want NAW. I will also drop Clark for the same reason, with the SG depth that the Grizzlies have. I don't think they'll get Toppin. The Pacers will use him in a bigger trade or keep him and run it back. NAW isn't the upgrade for that. This leaves Olynyk and Williams. I'll give them Williams. The Hornets would love to have NAW in their backcourt. He's better than everyone outside of Melo for them. The Wolves would love Williams. He brings experience and strength to the Wolves that they would love to keep around. This sets the Wolves at 215.157 million with 15 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the Wolves need a PG. Since Randle is picking up his option, he can be used in a trade. He is the player to use in a trade. We need to look for a team in need of a PF that has a PG. He's an expiring, so I believe a lot of teams would look to grab him. The Wolves are over the second apron here and can't aggregate players. Looking at options, it's not looking great. The only possible option would be the Magic or the Pelicans. Randle for McCollum or Randle for Anthony and Isaac. Neither team would do that, though. Neither team would need Randle. I just don't see a way the T-Wolves can get someone unless the Spurs would give up Castle. Something like Castle and Barnes for Randle would make some sense in a salary sense, but the Spurs may care more about keeping Castle than getting Randle. I wouldn't do that either. Honestly, the best bet might be trading NAW for a different player. Yeah, I think Mathurine could be an option or Derrick Jones Jr. I don't think Mathurine will go, but Jones Jr. would be a great option. The Clippers need to get younger and look into the future. NAW is a solid player to use in the future to give up the 28-year-old Jones Jr. This is probably the best option for all teams involved. This sets the T-Wolves at 211.511 million with 15 players."
