    "In this situation the question rises about Wendall Moore Jr.'s team option. On one hand I think for any team in the NBA that isn't over the second apron wouldn't resign him. However, the T-Wolves are over the second apron and don't have that luxury. I don't think he is worth 2.5 million dollar option and the T-Wolves should let him walk in free agency.\n",

Garza would need to walk, I don't think there is much value in keeping him at his price tag. In this Garza should walk.\n",

    "Now the question arises for Morris, Anderson, and McLaughlin. To me I think McLaughlin would be a fine player to keep on the roster for 4 million a year. Now the next question is Morris and Anderson. Morris and Anderson are interesting. I think you have to offer them the contracts and try to keep them. The issue is that they might have competition in the market as well as Morris not being worth the 18.6 million dollars. I would say if they can keep them then keep them, but they would have to compete in the market.\n",

    "Now trade options are the most interesting part of this. The T-Wolves have a lot of trade pieces, however, they would need to do a 1 for 1 swap, or the T-Wolves would get 2 or more players for the price of 1. Ant is untouchable. McDaniels is nearly untouchable. KAT is tradeable, however, his contract is on the longer end. I think that he is going to stay. Alexander-Walker is a possible piece, however, his 4.3 million dollars is hard to trade for 1 for 1 or a 1 for 2. I think that he stays. Conley can be traded but I don't think that he would get much value right now and is a good piece for this T-Wolves team. This leaves 2 options, Gobert and Reid. \n",

    "\n",
    "I think that the best trade option that the T-Wolves have is Rudy Gobert. The T-Wolves would need to try and get a backup big at either Center or Power Forward or if Anderson and/or Morris leave then a PG and SF would be necessary. Gobert would need to go to a playoff team or on the cusp of the playoff. These are the teams I can see that are interested.\n",

    "Looking at this the T-Wolves would just need some depth and good bench options that can add some offensive firepower. A team that would take Gobert would need an experienced defensive, rebounding Center. With that being said the Knicks could need that if Hartenstein leaves. The Magic would add him for more experience, the Bulls may take him to replace Vucevic and add some defensive presence, the Thunder would add him for rebounding purposes, the Suns would try to get him to try to make the current roster work, Pelicans can add him to replace Valanciunas, Kings would add him to try and make a push, the Grizzlies would add him to add some rebounding to the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at this I would eliminate the Knicks(assuming Hartenstein stays), Magic, Suns, Pelicans, and Kings as I don't think that they need to add the certain skillset of Gobert. The Knicks is the only team on here where I see them making a move but assuming even if Hartenstein leaves, the Knicks might need to try and get a different type of Center to replace him.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bulls receive: Rudy Gobert\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Wolves receive: Vucevic, Dosunmu, Patrick Williams in a sign and trade, and a first-rounder or 2 first-round swaps.\n",

    "Thunder receive: Rudy Gobert\n",

    "T-Wolves receive: Josh Giddey, Kenrich Williams, Cason Wallace, Jalen Williams\n",

    "This is a trade I can see happening, maybe dropping Jalen Williams and adding a bunch of draft picks but honestly, I don't see the T-Wolves taking that. The Thunder most likely won't trade Jalen Williams but honestly, that is the one piece that would make the T-Wolves take this pick. Ultimately I don't see Thunder making this trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Grizzlies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grizzlies receive: Rudy Gobert\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Wolves receive: Marcus Smart, Santi Aldama, GG Jackson, Vince Williams Jr., Brandon Clarke\n",

    "This would be a major trade. The Grizzlies would get Gobert, but gives up a lot of their depth to make this happen. Honestly, I don't see this happening unless the T-Wolves adds some picks in here and don't resign any of their free agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at all of these I don't think the Grizzlies or Thunder make the trade and I don't see the T-Wolves accepting the Bulls offer. I don't see a trade happening and if it does then the Bulls trade with some draft picks is the best offer I can make out. The Knicks is a team to look out for though. If they don't keep Hartenstein I can see this team make a push to try and get Gobert. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Knicks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Knicks receive: Rudy Gobert\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Wolves receive: Mitch Robinson, Bojan Bogdanovic, Miles McBride, and first-round pick\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't see the T-Wolves accepting this offer at all compared to the Bulls offer. The Bulls are at least giving up Vucevic and no one on this Knicks trade would match that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the trade were to happen then I can see a trade between the Bulls and the T-Wolves happening, however, I don't see that happening. I don't think that the T-Wolves would take Dosunmu nor do I think the Bulls can get Gobert and be a Championship team. I think that it's best for the T-Wolves to resign the 4 guys above, sign the 2 draft picks, and run it back and hope that Ant, Reid, and Alexander-Walker develop."
