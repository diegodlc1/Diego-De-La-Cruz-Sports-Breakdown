    "With the official end of the NBA season happening I wanted to take a look at the winners of the Western Conference, and Finals runner-ups, Dallas Mavericks. The Mavericks, have come out of nowhere at the end of the season. Looking at the route to the Finals I don't see many results due to injuries. Maybe if Leanard played for the Clippers that could've been a different result, but the wins over the Thunder and the T-Wolves show that they can beat that team. With that being said I will look at the the current contract situations for next year, extensions for the year after, and the potential free agency and trades that could be made."

The Mavs need to use the Room Exception to get Jones Jr. back on the team for next year. Offering the Max number, 12.9 million would put the Mavericks over the first-apron for next year. Offering Jones Jr. a 2-year 25.8 million with a player option in year 3 would be a solid offer. Jones Jr. may get offers from teams for more, with this offer, it gives Jones Jr. flexibility to leave after 2 more years and he is needed for the Mavs to compete again next year. The Mavs would then sign the last pick for around 1.2 million a year for next year. This puts the Mavs under the second-apron, and having 15 players on the team for next year."

A Championship competing team would look to improve the starting lineup over everything, and this would be the necessary push.

The Mavs will more than likely be priced out, but get these players if they can. That leaves Miami, Chicago, Toronto, Washington, and Portland. I honestly think that trying to get Jerami Grant or Kyle Kuzma is a better outcome than getting Duncan, Brown, or Caruso. I would rather have Caruso over Duncan, but both over Brown. Grant and Kuzma would be great pickups for the Mavs. Now granted, these are both natural Power Forwards, I think that Kuzma would be the best pickup.\n",
