    "The Clippers needed a backup PG, and Paul has been wanting to go back to the Clippers for this season. All in all, it's a fine addition. I like Chris Paul as a backup, and he brings a lot to a team that is looking to make a push in these next 2 seasons. Of the players who are going to get meaningful minutes this coming season, only Zubac is set to be under contract past the next 2 seasons. It's a fine strategy to get an old, expiring, but solid team to try and make this final push for all of their careers. My only issue is that I believe youth is necessary at certain times. Outside of Kawhi, no one has many injury concerns considering their age. You would expect a more fragile lineup. With that being said, you need the energy at certain points, and none of their guys can produce that energy naturally anymore. It's just tough all around. Either way, it's still a fine addition for the Clippers. I would've argued to look for a backup big, but there isn't much out there to do that. This is the next best option to shore up the Guard position and add from there. A solid B signing altogether."
