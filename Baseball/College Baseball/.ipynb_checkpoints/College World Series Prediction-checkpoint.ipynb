    "Looking at my predictions from last time, I feel like I did fine. Getting 4 of the 8 teams correct, I want to be able to predict the remainder of this tournament. Since this is a double elimination tournament until the 3 game final series, I'll try to predict the Semis, pick a winner, and then talk about the finals. With that being said here are my predictions for the remainder of this tournament."

    "I think that these are the 2 best-performing teams in this bracket. I think that North Carolina is the worst team in this bracket. They played in some of the closes games in this tournament against possibly weaker teams. This team will lose to Virginia and Tennessee. Virginia is a good team. I think that they have the best pitching on this side of the bracket but the batting isn't impressive. I think that Florida State and Tennessee have way better hitting than the other team, and only slightly worse pitching than Virginia. For that reason, Virginia will lose to both Tennessee and Florida State. In the end, I think Florida State is one of the best teams remaining. They will edge out Tennessee in 2 matches at the Semi-Finals.\n",

For NC State, they have one of the better bats remaining on this side of the bracket. However, I don't think that that's enough to get out of this situation. NC State will beat Florida, but they will lose to Kentucky First, beat Florida, then lose to Kentucky again. With that being said, Kentucky has the best remaining pitching in this tournament. However, Kentucky doesn't have enough bats to get past Texas A&M. They will beat NC State, lose to Texas A&M, beat NC State again, and then lose to NC State in 2 games. The winner of this group is A&M."
