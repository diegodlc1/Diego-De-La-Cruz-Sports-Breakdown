With that being said this year is kind of a strange year with the draft. The Guardians have the first pick while having the best record in the AL. It's also worth noting that a lot of first-rounders are coming from College this year, not that many high schoolers are seen to be top prospects this year. With that being said this is my note\n",

His one issue is that he does seem to chase pitches quite a bit but with some time in the Minors and playing at that level for a bit I can see him develop. If Condon goes up to the Majors in the next couple of years I see him being in the Outfield."

Possibly the best catching prospect in this draft in terms of both sides of the ball, Janek has good bat speed and strength at the plate. At the same time his defensive ability is a stand out as well. He has a good arm and his framing ability is also good. With that being said he's not that fast, but fast for a catcher, and he chases pitches a lot. It would be interesting to see how he develops."
