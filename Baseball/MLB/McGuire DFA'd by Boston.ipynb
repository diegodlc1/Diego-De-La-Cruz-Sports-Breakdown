    "Reese McGuire has been DFA'd by the Boston Red Sox after posting a .209/.280/.295 for this season. With the Red Sox he posted .264/.315/.370. He has been DFA'd with Chase Anderson to make room for James Paxton and Yohan Ramirez with Danny Jansen set to replace him. Since this is about McGuire I will mostly focus on where he might end up and only touch on the Red Sox with the moves of Paxton, Ramierez, and Anderson. "

    "This has been interesting for the Red Sox. Anderson is a better Catcher than McGuire. He offers more offensive firepower than McGuire. With that being said, I'm not sure about the pitching moves. I think that Anderson is a better relief pitcher than Ramierez and I don't know if Paxton would be a starter in the playoffs. I would say that Paxton is only better than Bello currently and you can make the arguemnet of Pivetta. I would say that in the long term developing Bello is better and Pivetta would be the only one that Paxton could be better. This could put him in the top 4 starters for the playoffs but I'm not 100% sure on that. With that being said I only feel confident in Jansen being better than McGuire out of all of these moves."

    "With a salary of only 1.5 million and another year of arbitration left, he will end up on a team soon. He could be a great backup or a starting Catcher on a team in need of a starter. Outside of his past, he should be able to drum up some interest in the market. I don't think he would go for much outside of just cash, but he would be able to get a job somewhere. I think he would be able to end up on any type of team. I think the main suspects would be Pittsburgh, Miami, and Detroit as the front runners for McGuire's service. I would say that the team with the highest chance is Pittsburgh but like I said I won't be surprised about the other moves or any other team. They would have control for next season and he's getting paid a modest contract for the remainder of this year. With that being said it would be interesting to see the outcome of all of this and where he would end up."
