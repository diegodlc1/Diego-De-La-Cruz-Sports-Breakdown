    "This is a solid signing all around. I do think that he is getting paid too much by Milan. From what I can see, Modric is set to be the second-highest-paid player on the Milan squad, but there is still a lot of the summer left for Milan to make more moves, and Modric will be fine being a top-end paid player on the squad. Other than that, this is a solid signing for all. Modric gets to continue to play at a top level while playing for his childhood favorite team. Milan needed to fill the CM position, and that is what is happening. Either way, paying Modric a reported 6.48 million Euros a year isn't amazing. I'm sure he had somewhat of a market, and this is paying the market price, but it seems like a lot for me for someone who is now 39 years old. He has been declining for a couple of years now, but nothing substantial, so I shouldn't be too surprised. I will give this signing a B-. I'm not high on the money number, but it isn't a deal breaker or anything."
