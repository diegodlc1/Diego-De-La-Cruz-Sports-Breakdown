    "With the Euros in full swing, I wanted to spend some time on shedding light with the other major international tournament going on this summer. This year's Copa America features the tournament being played in the United States with the 10 CONMEBOL members and 6 CONCACAF members included. I want to predict what I see happening in this tournament."

    "I think that this is how the table will look. For the first game, I think that Canada is truly a good team. They have enough experience to make a push in a major tournament. I think that overall, the Argentinian team is one of the best in this tournament. However, I think that this will be a prove-it game for Marsch. I think that he performs and they pull out a draw from this. For Peru and Chile, I think that Peru's defense is underrated and Chile has had some mediocre form recently. Outside Bravo and Sanchez, who are 41 and 35, I don't see much coming from this team. I think that Peru is just slightly younger and I feel like the backline is the best in this matchup, I think Peru advances. With that being said, Canada is just a better team than Peru, they win. Argentina will wake up after the Canada draw and they have a way better team than Chile, Argentina will win this. With that being said, Argentina is a better team than Peru, I see an easy win here. Now Canada and Chile will be interesting. I think that Chile will play for pride, knowing that they can't advance to the next round, and draw Canada to have the table be how it is."

    "In possibly the worse group in this tournament, we have 4 teams that could all honestly advance out of this group. With that being said, the first game will end up in a draw. I think that Ecuador has one of the best, if not the best, backline in this tournament, however, everything else is kind of lacking. I think that Venezuela is going to play this well and will end in a draw. I think in a early surprise Jamaica beats Mexico. Mexico is not good. This team is one of the worst I have seen in my lifetime. I think that if a team can beat Mexico they have to be either a CONCACAF team or a top tier team. With that being said, neither Ecuador and Venezuela are top tier teams. That's why I don't see either of them beating Mexico, especially after losing to Jamaica. With that being said, I don't think that Mexico is winning those either. I see 2 draws out of that. With this, I think that  Ecuador's defenese is good. If Leon Bailey was playing I could see Jamaica pulling a draw out of this, but he is not going to, so I think that the Ecuador defense is too much for Jamaica to break through. In the last game, I think that the pressue is too much for a team like Jamaica. I honestly think that Jamaica is the better team of the 2, however, in Copa America matches I trust a team like Venezuela to pull out a win. This would be the tournament that the Mexican FA needs to realize that they need to do something, and hopefully something is done before the next World Cup."

    "In this group, we have the hosts of this tournament, former winners in Uruguay, Panama, and Bolivia. Bolivia is one of the worst teams in the tournament, and most of the time if the game isn't played in La Plata they lose that game. I think that the US has a way better team than Bolivia and the home-field advantage, it's going to the US. Bielsa is the second-best manager in this tournament to me, outside of Marsch, however, the way that Bielsa plays and the talent that Uruguay has, Panama is a nightmare matchup for them. I like Panama's defense a lot to stop the attacking Uruguay team. The Uruguay-Panama game ends in a draw. In the second game, the US will struggle against Panama like always, however, I think that the US has too much-attacking talent. They win that game. Uruguay is playing to win and going up against Bolivia in the US means an easy win for Uruguay. In the final matchday, I think that Uruguay has a good team, but I do like the Americans a lot. I think that being at home helps the US pull out a draw, Bielsa plays too attacking leaving room for US counters. In the final game, we have 2 teams playing for pride. I think that it'll be a defensive match with Bolivia pulling out a late goal to win."

    "Brazil is currently in a weird place. I think that their manager situation is weird, I think that the team makeup isn't good, with good individual players. Colombia may come to a surprise for some, but if you look at this team, the midfield doesn't look great and while the attack and defense look good, I think that Costa Rica scraps hard like they did in the last World Cup. I also like Paraguay's team. I think it's very underrated. With that being said, Colombia draws with good form against Paraguay. Costa Rica upsets Brazil. I think they scrap at Brazil and win that game. I also think that Costa Rica upsets Colombia in a scrappy matchup again. Paraguay beats the lacking Brazilian team. With this Brazil and Colombia will be in a tight match with a draw coming out of that with both teams playing for something. Costa Rica falls to Paraguay in the final match day since I think that Costa Rica will come to this game tired after beating 2 top-tier teams. This may be weird to some but we've seen a Costa Rica team do this in a major tournament and I like Paraguay, I think that they're an underrated team. I think that they beat the hot team and the top dog in this tournament."

    "In this outcome, I predict that Group A and C come out of both knockout games. It makes sense as I think Group B is the weakest group and Group D had 2 of the weakest teams advance out of this round. I think that Argentina is just a better all around team. I really like Ecuador's backline, but outside of that I don't know where the goals are going to come from. I think that Canada is an underrated team and Canada will have the better players playing on the pitch on this night. USA and Costa Rica always plays in tough matches. I think that this would be another tough match but the home-field advantage pushes the Americans to the next round. Uruguay and Paraguay will be a tough match. I think that this will be a tough match and go into extras. In extras no one scores and go to penalties. I think Uruguay will have a penalty matchup and advance to the next round."

I think that at this point experience matters the most and both Uruguay and Argentina both have the experience and the talent to advance to the next round. I like the US and Canada, but I just don't think either team is that ready. I like the all around talent that both teams have, where the US and Canada lacks a backline and frontline respectively."
