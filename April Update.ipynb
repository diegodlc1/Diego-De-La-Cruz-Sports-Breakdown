    "I have officially been accepted to Law School and now have no concern about that aspect anymore, as well as being able to fix the github. With that being said, I learned that a huge aspect of preparing for law school is writing/typing. With that being said, from now until August, I will be typing and writing about sports every day until I start Law School. Once I start Law School, I will stop typing this and will pretty much go silent here until I get a chance to type again. I really like my offseason breakdowns, so I will emphasize that. The issue is that it will be just the NBA, NHL, and some international soccer. The issue with all of that is that I won't have all the time in the world to cover all of that and still give time to the NFL and MLB. Since I feel more comfortable with the NBA CBA, I will only write an offseason breakdown for the 30 NBA teams and try and give coverage for the rest. After the draft, after free agency, the MLB trade deadline, etc. I feel like the offseason breakdowns show the best ability I have and give interest to my job prospects and hopefully I impress. I will start Monday once the NBA season officially ends."
